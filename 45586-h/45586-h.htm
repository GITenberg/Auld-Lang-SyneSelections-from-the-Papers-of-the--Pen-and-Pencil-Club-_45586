That drowns the music of this earth.</p>

Of eyelash, quiver with a sweet surprise,<br />

<p class="poetry">Like Eve, who hid her from the dread command<br

Deep in the dewy blooms of paradise;<br />
So thy shy soul, love calling, fears to stand<br />

Asleep amid the fern, and waking, hears<br />
Some careless footstep drawing near, and flies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet knows not what she fears.</p>
<p class="poetry">So shrinks thy soul, but, dearest, shrink not
so;<br />
Look thou into mine eyes as I in thine,<br />
So our reflected souls shall meet and grow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And each with each combine</p>
<p class="poetry">In something nobler; as when one has laid<br />
Opposite mirrors on a cottage wall;<br />
And lo! the never-ending colonnade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The vast palatial hall.</p>
<p class="poetry">So our twin souls, by one sweet suicide,<br />
Shall fade into an essence more sublime;<br />
Living through death, and dying glorified,<br />

<span class="GutSmall">A LEGEND OF LONDON.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">By Thomas Ingoldsby</span>, <span
class="smcap">Minor</span>.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">In</span> days&mdash;not
old&mdash;a Demon lived,<br />
And a terrible Fiend was he,<br />
For he ground and he ground<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All London around,<br />
A huge barrel-organ of hideous sound,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Incessantly!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From morning&rsquo;s light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the deep midnight,<br />
In all sorts of streets and all sorts of squares.<br />
Up the <i>cul-de-sacs</i>&mdash;down the thoroughfares,<br />
Where Thames rolls his waters from Greenwich to Kew,<br />
Not a lane could you find that he didn&rsquo;t go through.<br />
You heard him at all times when most unaware,<br />
In quiet back-parlours up five flights of stair;<br />
When you ate, when you drank, when you read morning prayer,<br />
Or sat dozing awhile in an easy armchair,<br />
Or read a new novel&mdash;or talk&rsquo;d to a friend,<br />
Or endeavour&rsquo;d to settle accounts without end,<br />
Or when grief (or champagne), caused an ache in your head,<br />
Or you promised yourself to lie latish in bed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was all the same<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Demon came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grind! grind!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Peace there was none,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the sun;<br />
That odious organ never had done.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sick, sad, or sorry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No end to the worry.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No sort of grief<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brought the slightest relief;<br
/>
You might send out to say you were dying or dead,<br />
The organ ground on as if nothing were said!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grind! grind!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till you lost your mind.<br />
No use to scold, or draw down the blind,<br />
The fiend only ground more loud and more fast,<br />
Till you <i>had</i> to give him a shilling at last.<br />
So that having tormented you madly that day,<br />
He would surely next morning come round the same way,<br />
And grind and grind&mdash;till in frenzy of pain,<br />
You should bribe him once more&mdash;just to come back again!</p>
<p class="poetry">Know ye, my friends, who this Fiend may be?<br
/>
Here is the key to the mystery&mdash;<br />
It is <span class="smcap">Tubal Cain</span>! who&mdash;the Bible
says&mdash;<br />
Invented organs in very old days,<br />
And for that dread crime, so atrocious and black,<br />
Was sentenced thenceforth to bear one on his back,<br />
A heavier fate (as was justly his due),<br />
Than befell his Papa when poor Abel he slew:<br />
For Cain, killing <i>one</i> man, was let off quite
cheap&mdash;<br />
Tubal murdered us <i>all</i>&mdash;at least &ldquo;murder&rsquo;d
our sleep.&rdquo;</p>

The strength of the weak.<br />
Of those long cruel ages<br />
Of lust and of guile,<br />
Nought left us to-day<br />
But an innocent smile.<br />
For the labour&rsquo;d appeal<br />
Of the orator&rsquo;s art,<br />
A few foolish accents<br />
That reach to the heart.<br />
For those stern legions speeding<br />

Of the marvellous town<br />
With the salt-flowing street,<br />
Where colour burns deepest,<br />

This age has one redeeming point&mdash;it <i>mends</i>.<br />

But we have life and movement, we have hope.<br />
Oh! this is much!&nbsp; Thrice pitiable they<br />
Whose lot is cast in ages of decay,<br />
Who watch a waning light, an ebbing tide,<br />
Decline of energy and fall of pride,<br />
Old glories disappearing unreplaced,<br />
Receding culture and encroaching waste,<br />
Art grown pedantic, manners waxing coarse,<br />
The good thing still succeeded by the worse.<br />
We see not what those latest Romans saw,<br />
When o&rsquo;er Italian cities, Latin law,<br />
Greek beauty, swept the barbarizing tide,<br />
And all fair things in slow succession died.<br />
&rsquo;Tis much that such defeat and blank despair,<br />
Whate&rsquo;er our trials, &rsquo;tis not ours to bear,<br />
Much that the mass of foul abuse grows less,<br />
Much that the injured have sometimes redress,<br />
Wealth grows less haughty, misery less resigned,<br />

Alas! along the way towards social good,<br />
How many stones of dire offence lie strew&rsquo;d.<br />
Whence frequent failure, many shrewd mishaps<br />
And dismal pause or helpless backward lapse.<br />
Such was the hard reverse that Milton mourn&rsquo;d,<br />
An old man, when he saw the King returned<br />
With right divine, and that fantastic train<br />
Of banished fopperies come back again.<br />
Thus France, too wildly clutching happiness.<br />
Stumbled perplexed, and paid in long distress,<br />
In carnage, where the bloody conduit runs,<br />
And one whole generation of her sons<br />
Devoted to the Power of Fratricide<br />
For one great year, one eager onward stride.<br />

What wisest cautions may ensure us, say.<br />
Cling to the present good with steadfast grip,<br />

The past is dead,&mdash;let the dead have his dues,<br />
Remembrance of historian and of Muse;<br />
But try no lawless magic on the urn,<br />
It shocks to see the brightest past return.<br />
Some good things linger when their date is fled,<br />
These honour as you do the hoary head,<br />

And give them space, yet limit them with rule,<br />
And hold them down and keep them long at school:<br />
Yet know in these is life most fresh and strong,<br />
And that to these at last shall all belong.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be proved and present good thy safe-guard still,<br

And thy one quarrel be with present ill.<br />
Learn by degrees a steady onward stride<br />
With sleepless circumspection for thy guide.<br />
And since so thick the stumbling-blocks are placed,<br />
You are not safe but in renouncing haste;<br />
Permit not so your zeal to be repressed,<br />
But make the loss up by renouncing rest.</p>

for the other sect is more than I can explain, and I don&rsquo;t
blush to own free and frank as I believed the time for it in reel
life was past and gone these ages, though efforts made many a
year back at the Eglintown Turnamount rung through the country,
and well I remember seeing picters of queens o&rsquo; beauty and
gentlemen done up in harmer and a hossback as looked when once
they was hup it was more than they could do to save their lives

nature to go about with a shell outside of him like snails, which
is both slow and useless, <i>I</i> should say, unless making your
palings slimy and nibbling at your cabbage sprouts is useful
acts, which much I doubt, though how I&rsquo;ve got from Chivalry
to snails is most surpriging, only the workings of the huming
mind <i>is</i> so surpriging as no one never need be surpriged at
nothing of the sort,&mdash;where was I, ho at harmer which, if
you arx my opinion, I do consider such a ill-conwenience as there
ought to be a deal to make up for it, and if you can&rsquo;t have
Chivalry without harmer I must say I think we&rsquo;re better as
we are, fur what with crinnerlin the world&rsquo;s ardly big
enough as it is, and if these coats of male was to come in, made
of steel likewise, you couldn&rsquo;t walk in London, excep in
Portland Place, praps, and in quiet distrix like Islington and
Upper Baker Street, while as for omnibuses, my belief is
they&rsquo;re only kep going as it is by the lightness and
tightness of manly figgers and costoom, and if <i>they</i> took
to harmer there&rsquo;d be an end of twelve inside, much less of
thirteen out, and pit seats would have to be enlarged, as also
pews in church, and especially pulpits, likewise the Houses of
Parliament and the Corts of Lor, and everythink would be deranged
together fur no particklar good that I can see, but Mrs. Jones
she ses it&rsquo;s not the harmer, it&rsquo;s not the outside man
as needs a haltering in this year age of ourn, it&rsquo;s not the
costoom she ses, it&rsquo;s the manners, she ses, which in
ancient times was so much superior to any think we know on in the
presint day, she ses, fur in them distant days there was galliant
knights which wore a scarve or a ribbing of the lady as they
preferred, and went about the world with long spears a defying
all the other knights to say as that there lady of theirs
wasn&rsquo;t the most beautifulest of all living ladies, and <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>fight they
would with them spears, and sometimes got ard nox too, in spite
of their harmer, but got up again a hossback mostly, and went off
to other parts a doing the same thing, which, if that&rsquo;s
chivalry, why I arx you what on erth is the good of such goings
on as that, but ho Mrs. Jones ses, that&rsquo;s not all, she ses,
and torx at me fur hours on end, she does, a trying to show me
what a deal more obliginger and politer was the manners of them
there knights to the manners of these year days, and how they was
always a helping of the helpless, and a succouring the
distressed, and how they thought it a honner and no trouble to
put theirselves to all sorts of inconvenience to oblige one of
our sect which, especially the unprotected female, was their joy
and pride, never you mind how many bangboxes she might have, nor
how pouring of rain, outside of the omnibuses of the period them
knights would go immediate, and only count it a ordinary part of
what they called their devour to the fare, which I will own I
<i>have</i> met with quite contrairy condick from well drest
pussons, as doubtless calls theirselves gentlemen, and after
standing hours, I may say, in Regint Circus or corner of
Tottenham Court Road, have been pushed from getting of my place
inside by the very harms that in other times Mrs. Jones ses would
have been lifted to my haid, but lor! I ses to her, though this
may appen occasional, I ses, what can you expeck in London in the
midst of millions of snobs as thinks only of theirselves, and has
never learned any better, poor deers, which I&rsquo;m sorry fur
&rsquo;em, fur sure I am as the feelins is much more comfortabler
of a reel and right down <i>gentle</i> man, which the word
explains itself, don&rsquo;t it, and we don&rsquo;t want no
knights in harmer while there&rsquo;s men left, and proud I am to
say I know a many such, and have met with kindness from a many
more as I don&rsquo;t know the names on, <a

they&rsquo;d had harmer on twice over couldn&rsquo;t be more
ready to lend their strength to the weak, and their elp to the
elpless, and chivalry can&rsquo;t mean no more than that, so let
alone the harmer, we can&rsquo;t have too much of it, <i>I</i>
ses, and Mrs. Jones she ses so too, and we ses it not as wimming
only but as humane beings as likes to see their feller creeturs a
growing in good arts and appiness, not forgetting as wimming
likewise has <i>our</i> duties, which is seldom done as well as
one could wish, and so has no manner of rite to preech, which
much I fear I&rsquo;ve been a running on most unconscionable, and
took up a deal too much of your time, but umbly arx your parding

<h3>I.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Who</span> cares to think
of autumn leaves in spring?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the birds
sing,<br />
And buds are new, and every tree is seen<br />
Veil&rsquo;d in a mist of tender gradual green;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And every bole and bough<br />
Makes ready for the soft low-brooding wings<br />
Of nested ones to settle there and prove<br />

<p class="poetry">For, hath not spring the promise of the

With cowslips fair her fragrant fields are set;<br />

And <i>know</i> the sweet notes they are softly singing;<br />
I see the green leaves trembling in the breeze,<br />

But oh! to my deaf ears there comes no sound,<br />

<h2><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>LIGHTS
AND SHADOWS.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Dear</span> heart! what a
little time it is, since Francis and I used to walk<br />
From church in the still June evenings together, busy with loving
talk;<br />
And now he is gone far away over seas, to some strange foreign
country,&mdash;and I<br />
Shall never rise from my bed any more, till the day when I come
to die.</p>
<p class="poetry">I tried not to think of him during the prayers;
but when his dear voice I heard<br />
I fail&rsquo;d to take part in the hymns, for my heart
flutter&rsquo;d up to my throat like a bird;<br />
And scarcely a word of the sermon I caught.&nbsp; I doubt
&rsquo;twas a grievous sin;<br />
But &rsquo;twas only one poor little hour in the week that I had
to be happy in.</p>
<p class="poetry">When the blessing was given, and we left the
dim aisles for the light of the evening star,<br />
Though I durst not lift up my eyes from the ground, yet I knew
that he was not far;<br />
And I hurried on, though I fain would have stayed, till I heard
his footstep draw near,<br />
And love rising up in my breast like a flame, cast out every
shadow of fear.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah me! &rsquo;twas a pleasant pathway home, a
pleasant pathway and sweet,<br />
Ankle deep through the purple clover, breast high &rsquo;mid the
blossoming wheat:<br />
<a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>I can hear
the landrails call through the dew, and the night-jars&rsquo;
tremulous thrill,<br />
And the nightingale pouring her passionate song from the hawthorn
under the hill.</p>
<p class="poetry">One day, when we came to the wicket gate,
&rsquo;neath the elms, where we used to part,<br />
His voice began to falter and break as he told me I had his
heart;<br />
And I whisper&rsquo;d that mine was his; we knew what we felt
long ago:<br />
Six weeks are as long as a lifetime almost when you love each
other so.</p>
<p class="poetry">So we put up the banns, and were man and wife
in the sweet fading time of the year,<br />
And till Christmas was over and past I knew neither sorrow nor
fear.<br />
It seems like a dream already, a sweet dream vanished and
gone;<br />
So hurried and brief while passing away, so long to look back
upon.</p>
<p class="poetry">I had only had him three months, and the world
lay frozen and dead,<br />
When the summons came which we feared and hoped, and he
sail&rsquo;d over sea for our bread.<br />
Ah well! it is fine to be wealthy and grand, and never to need to
part;<br />
But &rsquo;tis better to love and be poor, than be rich with an
empty heart.</p>
<p class="poetry">Though I thought &rsquo;twould have
kill&rsquo;d me to lose him at first, yet was he not going for
me?<br />
So I hid all the grief in my breast which I knew it would pain
him to see.<br />
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>He&rsquo;d
be back by the autumn, he said; and since his last passionate
kiss<br />
He has scarcely been out of my thoughts, day or night, for a
moment, from that day to this.</p>
<p class="poetry">When I wrote to him how I thought it would be,
and he answered so full of love;<br />
Ah! there was no angel happier than I, in all the bright chorus
above;<br />
And I seem&rsquo;d to be lonely no longer, the days slipp&rsquo;d
so swiftly away;<br />
And the March winds died, and the sweet April showers gave place
to the blossoms of May.</p>
<p class="poetry">And then came the sad summer eve, when I sat
with the little frock in the sun,<br />
And Annie ran in with the news of the ship.&nbsp; Ah, well! may
His will be done!<br />
They said that all hands were lost, and I swoon&rsquo;d away like
a stone,<br />
And another life came ere I knew he was safe, and that mine was
over and gone.</p>
<p class="poetry">So now I lie helpless here, and shall never
rise up again,<br />
I grow weaker and weaker, day by day, till my weakness itself is
a pain.<br />
Every morning the creeping dawn, every evening I see from my
bed<br />
The orange-gold fade into lifeless grey, and the old evening star
overhead.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sometimes in the twilight dim, or the awful
birth of the day,<br />
As I lie, not asleep nor awake, my soul seems to flutter away,<br
/>
<a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>And I seem
to be floating beyond the stars, till I thrill with an exquisite
pain,<br />
And the feeble touch of a tiny hand recalls me to life again.</p>
<p class="poetry">And the doctor says she will live.&nbsp; Ah!
&rsquo;tis hard to leave her alone,<br />
And to think she will never know in the world the love of the
mother who&rsquo;s gone!<br />
He will tell her of me, by and by,&mdash;she will shed me a
childish tear;<br />
But if I should stoop to her bed in the night, she would start
with a horrible fear.</p>
<p class="poetry">She will grow into girlhood, I trust, and will
bask in the light of love,<br />
And I, if I see her at all, shall only look on from
above&mdash;<br />
I shall see her, and cannot help, though she fall into evil and
woe.<br />
Ah! how can the angels find heart to rejoice when they think of
their loved ones below?</p>
<p class="poetry">And Francis, he too, will forget me, and will
go on the journey of life,<br />
And I hope, though I dare not think of it yet, will take him
another wife.<br />
It will scarcely be Annie, I think, though she liked him in days
gone by;<br />
Was that why she came?&mdash;but what thoughts are these for one
who is going to die?</p>
<p class="poetry">I hope he will come ere I go, though I feel no
longer the thirst<br />
For the sound of his voice, and the light of his eye, that I used
to feel at first:<br />
<a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>&rsquo;Tis
not that I love him less, but death dries, like a whirlwind of
fire,<br />
The tender springs of innocent love, and the torrents of strong
desire.</p>
<p class="poetry">And I know we shall meet again.&nbsp; I have
done many things that are wrong,<br />
But, surely, the Lord of Life and of Love, cannot bear to be
angry long.<br />
I am only a girl of eighteen, and have had no teacher but
love;<br />
And, it may be, the sorrow and pain I have known will be counted
for me, above;</p>
<p class="poetry">For I doubt if the minister knows all the
depths of the goodness of God,<br />
When he says He is jealous of earthly love, and bids me bow down
&rsquo;neath the rod.<br />
He is learn&egrave;d and wise, I know, but, somehow, to dying
eyes<br />
God opens the secret doors of the shrine that are closed to the
learn&egrave;d and wise.</p>
<p class="poetry">So now I am ready to go, for I know He will do
what is best,<br />
Though he call me away while the sun is on high, like a child
sent early to rest.<br />
I should like to see Francis look on our child, though the
longing is over and past&mdash;<br />
But what is that footstep upon the stair?&nbsp; Oh! my
darling&mdash;at last! at last!</p>

36</span>ECHOES.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> Thursday I sat in the choir of
Canterbury Cathedral and watched the Bishops, Deans, Canons, and
other clergy as they walked up in procession, leading the new
Archbishop.&nbsp; The Archbishop seemed, I thought, to look with
sheepish glances at two young men in full ball-room dress, who
walked behind, holding up his long train; and I am satisfied that
nothing but the proprieties of the place prevented his Grace from
kicking them both, and carrying his tail in his own hands.&nbsp;
The clergy, in their white gowns, with their various University
colours, presented a rather pleasant appearance in the aggregate,
and, with the environment of the old Cathedral arches, I thought
they must have appeared to the best advantage.&nbsp; But while I
gazed upon the old Archbishop and those who were doing him
homage, the first notes of a distant chant broke faintly through
the air.&nbsp; The choristers had just entered the western door
far away, and as they slowly moved at the end of the long
procession, they uttered a sweet old Gregorian chant.&nbsp; At
first, as I listened, I thought how very sweet it was; then I
thought it was in danger of becoming monotonous; nevertheless,
the little cherubs had not consulted me about the length of it,
and so continued their chant.&nbsp; But then the old music began
to strike me with subtle effects, like the strain of some long
sound-seasoned Cremona violin.&nbsp; And at length it began to
work some strange spell upon me, and weave for my ear echoes
caught <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>up
as it were from the dead past which before had seemed sleeping in
its many tombs around.&nbsp; The echoes of wild pagan song,
uttered with the tramp of mystic dances, gathering at last to the
dying groan of some poor wretch perishing on a rude altar that a
complacent smile may be won to the face of his god.&nbsp; The
echo of the voice of a monk who finds that altar, and raises the
crucifix above it.&nbsp; His voice blends with the outcry of the
people for their old gods, and the loud command of the baptized
King.&nbsp; What wild echoes are these hiding under that outburst
of young voices?&nbsp; The echoes of a thousand savage martyrs
who will not bow down to the Pope.&nbsp; Their protest is stifled
with their blood; they pass to Valhalla for whose All-Father they
have died; and the howling tempest marks his passage over the
scene.&nbsp; Echoes again; the sounds of war.&nbsp; Hark! a
tumult&mdash;words of anger&mdash;a hoarse cry&mdash;an
Archbishop&rsquo;s last sigh as his life ebbs away on the
floor&mdash;there on the spot near the choir&rsquo;s gate, where
Archbishop Tait now gazes as if he could see the stark form of
&agrave;-Becket lying there.&nbsp; Yes, plainly I heard that
groan in the Gregorian chant.&nbsp; Then there were the echoes of
stripes.&nbsp; A King in the dark crypt, beneath the shrine of
the murdered Archbishop, now canonized, is being scourged in
penance for his sins.&nbsp; Blended with these, the echoes of the
voices of the great prelates and princes of many kingdoms, who
have come to build a shrine for the martyr: their exclamations
before the shrine decked with all the gleaming gems owned by the
monarchs of Europe.&nbsp; One of them, Louis of France, has
refused to offer a diamond, the finest in the world, but when the
shrine is uncovered, the stone leaps from his ring and sets
itself in the centre of the brilliants.&nbsp; The people shout,
nay, weep with excitement at this miracle.&nbsp; All these I
heard again in the chant.&nbsp; Then <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>came pathetic echoes out of many
ages: the tones of mourners as they followed here their honoured
dead; the prayers of souls here aspiring towards the mysteries of
existence; voices of hearts that found peace; the sobs of those
who found it not; the low-toned benediction or exhortation of
confessors.&nbsp; The voices of priests from pulpits, and of
those who responded.&nbsp; All are hushed in death; but I heard
their awakened echoes.&nbsp; The echoes of tolling bells, of
marriage chimes.&nbsp; The tones of marriage vows.&nbsp; The
startled cry of the infant wondering at the holy water sprinkled
upon it.&nbsp; The echoes of Chaucer&rsquo;s merry or sad
pilgrims with their gracious or wanton stories, beguiling their
way to the old inn near Christ Church Gate, which one seeks now
only to find it has been burnt down.&nbsp; The echoes of their
prayers for health at St. Dunstan&rsquo;s or St. Thomas&rsquo;s
Shrine, and that other shrine where the stones are worn deepest
with the knees of pilgrims, but whose saint is unknown.&nbsp; All
these echoes were awakened for my ear by the sweet chant of the
boys in Canterbury Cathedral; and unreal as they were, I confess
they still seem to me more real than the actual prayers for the
confusion of Dr. Tait&rsquo;s imaginary enemies, or the ceremony
of his enthronement.&nbsp; To sit upon fourteen centuries and see
a London gentleman in a coat so much too large for him that his
friends have to hold up its skirts for him, and to see plethoric
Englishmen, suggestive of sirloins, on their knees praying that
the snares set for their feet shall be broken,&mdash;produced in
me feelings, to say the least, of a mixed character; such as
those which may have been experienced by the landlady in the
Strand, when she found that her lodger Mr. Taylor (the Platonist)
had sacrificed a bull to Jupiter in her back parlour.&nbsp; There
is something not undignified in an old Greek sacrificing a
heifer, laurel-crowned, to <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>Zeus; and there is something not
unimpressive in old missionaries of the Cross struggling with
pagan foes, and symbolizing their faith in their vesture and in
their candles which lit up the caves to which they often had to
fly.&nbsp; But to the crowd that went down between business and
business, to see so long as a return-ticket permitted this effigy
of a real past, there must have been more absurdity than
impressiveness in it.&nbsp; From the whole pageant I recall with
pleasure only the long sweet chant,&mdash;a theme ensouled by
genius and piety,&mdash;which, between the doorway and the altar,
filled the old Cathedral and made it a vast organ, with historic
tones breathing the echoes of millions of heaven-seeking pilgrims
whose prayers and hymns began at that spot before the advent of
Christianity, and may perhaps remain there after it has passed
away.</p>

40</span>EXPEDIENCY.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Thus</span> to his scholars
once Confucius said:<br />
Better to die than not be rich: get wealth.<br />
He who has nothing, trust me, nothing is;<br />
Nay, tenfold worse than nothing.&nbsp; Not to be<br />
Is neither good nor bad; but to be poor!&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Tis to be nothing with an envious wish,<br />
A zero conscious of nonentity.<br />
To get wealth, and to keep it&mdash;this is all,<br />
And the one rule of life, expediency.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the lesson that the master taught,<br />
And then he gave some rules for getting wealth:<br />
Happy, who once can say, I have a thing.<br />
All things are given us, all things to be had,<br />
Except, alas! the faculty of having.<br />
If you are sated with one dish of fruit,<br />
Why, no more fruit have you, to call it having,<br />
Though a whole Autumn lay in heaps about you.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How to <i>have</i>, this, my scholars, would I
teach.<br />
Yet who can teach it? it is great and hard.<br />
This one thing dare I say.&nbsp; Be not deceived,<br />
Nor dream that those called rich <i>have</i> anything;<br />
Who think that what the pocket treasures up,<br />
And jealous foldings of the robe, is theirs;<br />
Theirs all the plate the burglar cannot reach,<br />
Theirs all the land they warn the traveller off:<br />
Fools!&nbsp; Because we are poorer, are they rich?<br />
What is none other&rsquo;s, is it therefore theirs?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>Endeavour, O my scholars, to be rich,<br />
Scheme to get riches when you wake from sleep,<br />
All day pursue them, pray for them at night.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As when one leans long time upon his hand,<br />
Then, moving it, finds all its strength is gone<br />
And it can now grasp nothing, so the soul<br />
Loses in listlessness the grasping power,<br />
And in the midst of wealth, <i>has</i> nothing still.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I know not, O my scholars, how to bring<br />
The tingling blood through the soul&rsquo;s palsied limbs,<br />
But when &rsquo;tis done how rich the soul may be<br />
How royal in possessions, I can tell,&mdash;<br />
One half of wisdom&mdash;seek elsewhere the other.<br />
The gods divorce knowledge of good from good.<br />
He who is happy and rich does seldom know it,<br />
And he who knows the true wealth seldom has it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only all this world of eye and ear<br />
Becomes his house and palace of delights<br />
Whose soul has grasping power; so that each form<br />
To him becomes a picture that is his,<br />
The light-stream as a fountain in his court,<br />
The murmur of all movement music to him,<br />
And time&rsquo;s mere lapse rhythmical in his heart.<br />
Not only so; a greater treasure still,<br />
The lives of other men, by sympathy<br />
Incorporated with his own, are his.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Get wealth, my scholars, this wealth first of
all.<br />
One life is beggary; live a thousand lives.<br />
In those about you live and those remote;<br />
Live many lives at once and call it country,<br />
And call it kind; in the great future live<br />
And make it in your life rehearse its life,<br />
And make the pallid past repeat its life.<br />
Be public-hearted and be myriad-soul&rsquo;d,<br />
<a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>So shall
you noble be as well as rich,<br />
And as a king watch for the general good.<br />
Raised to a higher level, you shall find<br />
With large enjoyments vast constraints, vast cares.<br />
Be swayed by wider interests, be touched<br />
By wiser instincts of the experienced heart,<br />
And, since all greatness is a ponderous weight,<br />
Be capable of vaster sufferance.<br />
Your joys shall be as heaven, your griefs as hell.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rise early, O my scholars, to be rich,<br />
And make Expediency your rule of life.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, when the utmost scale of wealth is
gain&rsquo;d,<br />
And other lives are to your own annex&rsquo;d<br />
By the soul&rsquo;s grasping power, this guide of life,<br />
This sure Expediency, shall suffer change.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When appetites shall tame to prudences<br />
And Prudence purge herself to Sacred Law,<br />
When lusts shall sweeten into sympathies,<br />
And royal Justice out of Anger spring,<br />
When the expanding Self grows infinite,<br />
Then shall Expediency, the guide of life,<br />
In Virtue die, in Virtue rise again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Friend</span>,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of your meeting of
to-morrow is so suggestive that I would gladly join you all, and
write an essay on it, if I had health and time.&nbsp; I have
neither, and, perhaps, better so.&nbsp; My essay, I candidly
avow, would tend to prove that no essay ought to be written on
the subject.&nbsp; It has no reality.&nbsp; A sort of intuitive
instinct led you to couple &ldquo;Ghosts and Rest&rdquo;
together.</p>
<p>There is, here down, and there ought to be, no Rest.&nbsp;
Life is an <i>aim</i>; an aim which can be <i>approached</i>, not
<i>reached</i>, here down.&nbsp; There is, therefore, no
rest.&nbsp; Rest is immoral.</p>
<p>It is not mine now to give a definition of the <i>aim</i>;
whatever it is, there is one, there <i>must</i> be one.&nbsp;
Without it, Life has no sense.&nbsp; It is atheistical; and,
moreover, an irony and a deception.</p>
<p>I entertain all possible respect for the members of your Club;
but I venture to say that any contribution on Rest which will not
exhibit at the top a definition of Life will wander sadly between
wild arbitrary intellectual display and commonplaces.</p>
<p>Life is no sinecure, no &ldquo;<i>recherche du
bonheur</i>&rdquo; to be secured, as the promulgators of the
theory had it, by guillotine, or, as their less energetic
followers have it, by railway shares, selfishness, or
contemplation.&nbsp; Life is, as Schiller said, &ldquo;a battle
and a march;&rdquo; a battle for Good against Evil, for Justice
against arbitrary privileges, for Liberty against Oppression, for
associated Love <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>against Individualism; a march onwards to Self, through
collective Perfecting, to the progressive realization of an
Ideal, which is only dawning to our mind and soul.&nbsp; Shall
the battle be finally won during life-time?&nbsp; Shall it on
Earth? are we believing in a Millennium?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t we
feel that the spiral curve through which we ascend had its
beginning elsewhere, and has its end, if any, beyond this
terrestrial world of ours?&nbsp; Where is then a possible
foundation for your essays and sketches?</p>
<p>Goethe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Contemplation&rdquo; has created a
multitude of little sects aiming at Rest, where is no Rest,
falsifying art, the element of which is evolution, not
re-production, transformation, not contemplation, and enervating
the soul in self-abdicating Brahmanic attempts.&nbsp; For
God&rsquo;s sake let not your Club add one little sect to the
fatally existing hundreds!</p>
<p>There is nothing to be looked for in life except the
uninterrupted fulfilment of Duty, and, not Rest, but consolation
and strengthening from Love.&nbsp; There is, not rest, but a
promise, a shadowing forth of Rest in Love.&nbsp; Only there must
be in Love absolute <i>trust</i>; and it is very seldom that this
blessing depends on us.&nbsp; The child goes to sleep, a
dreamless sleep, with unbounded trust, on the mother&rsquo;s
bosom; but <i>our</i> sleep is a restless one, agitated by sad
dreams and alarms.</p>
<p>You will smile at my lugubrious turn of mind; but if I was one
of <i>your</i> Artists, I would sketch a man on the scaffold
going to die for a great Idea, for the cause of Truth, with his
eye looking trustfully on a loving woman, whose finger would
trustfully and smilingly point out to him the unbounded.&nbsp;
Under the sketch I would write, not Rest, but &ldquo;a Promise of
Rest.&rdquo;&nbsp; Addio: tell me one word about the point of
view of your contributors.</p>

49</span>GOSSIP.</h2>
<p>I <span class="GutSmall">FEEL</span> impelled to say a word,
and it shall be but a word&mdash;and so more patiently
endured&mdash;in defence of that much abused, much maligned
thing&mdash;gossipry.&nbsp; Johnson, among many other
designations, gives for &ldquo;gossipred,&rdquo; &ldquo;spiritual
affinity;&rdquo; a very good definition, and the one I shall
adopt; that is, sympathy, the need to give and to receive it; and
I must say I know few things more charming than this sympathy in
small things, this gossipry between kindly hearts and well filled
heads.&nbsp; That light pouring out the thoughts and feelings and
observations of the passing hour, which, while it commences with
the external, is sure to touch, ever and anon, those deeper
springs of thought, and feeling, and action, from which well up
pleasant memories, apt thoughts, and pertinent reflections.</p>
<p>Poring over old letters and papers which chanced recently to
come into my hands, I came upon an old leaf of yellow paper and
faded ink, which caught my attention; it appeared to be either a
scrap of an old diary, or of a letter; it seemed to me somewhat
germane to our present subject, and being venerable from its
antiquity, I venture to quote it.&nbsp; Its date is too
indistinct to be sure of, but it seems to be 1700 and
something.&nbsp; Thus it runs:&mdash;&ldquo;My husband was bidden
to dinner yesterday to our Rector&rsquo;s, I with him; my husband
was pleased thereat, because there was, he said, to be there a
man of parts, from London; so I laid out my husband&rsquo;s best
coat and long <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>flowered waistcoat, and his kerseys and silk stockings,
which he did not often wear, for I desired him to be seemly in
his attire, that he might do fitting honour to our Rector; I was
a little flustered at first with the notion of this great man;
but I noted that my husband bore himself towards him exactly as
if he had been an ordinary man.&nbsp; At table I found myself set
next to him.&nbsp; The gardens at the great house are very fine,
and kept excellently well, as indeed is not wonderful, as there
are two whole gardeners and a boy to do the work.&nbsp; Looking
out of the large bay-window which looked upon the flower garden,
and stood open, for it was mighty warm, I could not keep my eyes
off the flowers, they were so exceeding gay; the sun shone out
surprisingly; one spot in particular took my attention: a large
clump of daffodils had been allowed on the lawn, the grass was
high round them, and on the top of every blade there was a drop
that sparkled like a diamond&mdash;for there had been a slight
shower&mdash;and as I looked upon them, I thought of the
description in holy writ of the gates of the temple of Jerusalem,
all studded with sapphires and emeralds and diamonds; and I was
so taken up that I forgot it was the great man that was sitting
by me, and I asked him if it was not beautiful?&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is vastly fine indeed, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; he said; but he looked
at me with wonderment, I thought, and from the look in his eyes,
I am sure he did not know a daffodil from a daisy, poor
man.&nbsp; So I felt very much abashed, and sat still and said no
more; and there was not much discourse, but everybody looked wise
and silent; and I remembered that somewhere it is said, it is a
grand thing to know how to be silent; but I thought a little
talking would have been more agreeable, only perhaps not so
wise-like, only of course I knew I was quite a common person, and
had no parts at all; so when it was <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>about three of the clock&mdash;the
hour fixed for the dinner was rather late, as it was a bye common
occasion&mdash;and we ladies left the gentlemen to settle down to
their wine, I thought I would go home to my children, for I
thought our lady Rector looked somewhat puffed up and stately
with the great honour she had had, and done to us; and to say the
very truth, I felt longing to speak and to hear in the ordinary
way.&nbsp; So I took my leave in a beseeming and courteous
manner, and stepped across to my own place; and my eldest
daughter came running to me and said she had got so many things
to tell me; and then out of her little heart she poured out all
her little troubles and pleasures; and oh! she said, little
brother had been so naughty, and had cried dreadfully for the
pretty cup from China, and stamped and fought her when she would
not let him have it, because dear mamma liked it so much, and
would be sorry to have it broken.&nbsp; &lsquo;But then,
mamma,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;when he got a little quieter, I
talked to him, and hushed him and kissed him, and so he was soon
good, and we had a great game at horses.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then I
kissed the little maid, and called her a &lsquo;dear little
mother,&rsquo; but she was greatly puzzled, and said, &lsquo;Oh,
mamma, I am only a little girl.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then she said I must
tell her all about the gentleman that she had heard papa say had
a great many parts&mdash;&lsquo;more, I suppose, mamma, than any
of us.&rsquo;&nbsp; I only kissed her at this, and told her of
the golden daffodils and many other flowers I had noticed; and of
two great blackbirds I had seen hopping very lovingly together
upon the lawn.&nbsp; She said she liked to hear of these
extremely; and I told of the roast sucking-pig with an orange in
its mouth, which was at the top of the table; but she did not
like this; she said it would remind her of the little piggy
running about, which that little pig would never do any
more.&nbsp; Then she said she would tell me of one of <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>her little
misfortunes, which she thought was almost a big one: &lsquo;the
poor brown hen with ten little chicks had been shut up by
themselves, because the little chicks would run about too far;
and the boy had forgotten them, and they had been shut up without
anything to eat for ever so many hours; and when we put some
barley in, dear old browney clucked and clucked, and showed the
grains to the chicks, but never touched one herself, mamma, and
when the little chicks had eaten till they were quite full, she
called them all under her wings, and they went fast asleep; but
then, mamma, there was not one single barley left near the poor
mother; and so I do believe mamma, she would have been quite
starved to death, only we put some barley and some nice crumbs
quite close to her; so she got them without moving a bit, or
waking the chicks, and oh, mamma, she did gobble it up so fast; I
know she was so hungry, for she did not eat one single
barley-corn before, for I watched her all the time; wasn&rsquo;t
it sweet and good of her, mamma?&nbsp; I shall love that dear old
browney for always.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so my little daughter and I
chatted away and enjoyed ourselves hugely, till my dear good man,
who I had thought was sitting over his wine, and perhaps his
pipe&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t know about that because of the
company&mdash;came suddenly behind us.&nbsp; He kissed us both,
saying, &lsquo;My two sweet gossips, it does my heart good to
hear you.&nbsp; It seems to me, my Margery,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;that our little one here hath both a sound heart and a
wise head.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There the paper is torn, and I could see no other word.&nbsp;
It appears to me that this, and many other gossipries, are, in
their small way, good, and that when they are not good, it is
because the heart is cankered, and the head empty; and so we come
round to the conclusion on all subjects and on all difficulties,
especially social difficulties&mdash;<a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>educate, educate, educate; teach the
mind to find subjects for thought in all things, and purify the
heart by enabling it to find &ldquo;sermons in stones, and good
in everything;&rdquo; then will Gossip be the graceful unbending
of the loving heart and well-filled head.</p>

54</span>CHIPS.</h2>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">Chips</span>! chips!<br />
We had climb&rsquo;d to the top of the cliff that day,<br />
Just where the brow look&rsquo;d over the bay;<br />
And you stood, and you watch&rsquo;d the shifting ships<br />
Till I found you a seat in the heather.<br />
As we reach&rsquo;d the top you had touch&rsquo;d me thrice;<br
/>
I had felt your hand on my shoulder twice,<br />
And once I had brush&rsquo;d your feather.<br />
And I turn&rsquo;d at last, and saw you stand,<br />
Looking down seaward hat in hand,<br />
At the shelving sweep of the scoop&rsquo;d-out sand,<br />
And the great blue gem within it.<br />
The bright, sweet sky was over your head,<br />
Your cheek was aflame with the climber&rsquo;s red,<br />
And a something leapt in my heart that said,&mdash;<br />
Happy or sorry, living or dead,&mdash;<br />
My fate had begun that minute.<br />
And we sat, and we watch&rsquo;d the clouds go by<br />
(There were none but the clouds and you and I<br />
As we sat on the hill together);<br />
As you sketch&rsquo;d the rack as it drifted by,<br />
Fleece upon fleece through the pathless sky,<br />
Did you wonder, Florence, whether,<br />
When you held me up your point to cut,<br />
I had kept the chips, when the knife was shut,&mdash;<br />
For none of them fell in the heather.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a

chips!&mdash;<br />
Yet what was I but the cousin, you know?&mdash;<br />
Only the boy that you favour&rsquo;d so&mdash;<br />
And the word that stirr&rsquo;d my lips<br />
I must hide away in my heart, and keep,<br />
For the road to you was dizzy and steep<br />
As the cliff we had climb&rsquo;d together.<br />
There was many an older lover nigh,<br />
With the will and the right to seek your eye;<br />
And for me, I know not whether,<br />
If I chose to live, or I chose to die,<br />
It would matter to you a feather.<br />
But this I know, as the feather&rsquo;s weight<br />
Will keep the poise of the balance straight,<br />
In the doubtful climb&mdash;in the day&rsquo;s eclipse,<br />
In the stumbling steps, in the faults and trips,<br />
I have gain&rsquo;d a strength from the tiniest scraps<br />
That ever were help to a man, perhaps,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chips! chips!</p>
<p class="poetry">Look, these are &ldquo;the tiniest
scraps,&rdquo; you see,<br />
And this is their casket of filigree,<br />
That I bought that year &ldquo;far over the sea,&rdquo;<br />
With a volley of chaff, and a half-rupee,<br />
From a huckstering, fox-faced Bengalee,<br />
That set himself up for a dealer.<br />
They have slept with me by the jungle fires,<br />
They have watch&rsquo;d with me under Indian spires,<br />
I have kept them safe in their gilded wires<br />
From the clutch of the coolie stealer;<br />
And when at last they relieved &ldquo;the Nest,&rdquo;&mdash;<br
/>
Alick, and Ellis, and all the rest,&mdash;<br />
March&rsquo;d into Lucknow four abreast,<br />
That I had the chips still under my vest,<br />
<a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>That they
pray&rsquo;d with me, must be confess&rsquo;d,<br />
Who never was much of a kneeler.<br />
And now that I come, and I find you free,<br />
You, that have waken&rsquo;d this thing in me,<br />
Will you tell me, Florence, whether,<br />
When I kept your pencil&rsquo;s chips that day,<br />
Was it better perhaps to have let them stay<br />
To be lost in the mountain heather!</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Chips</span>!&nbsp; It may
be well disputed<br />
If a word exists, less suited,<br />
Or more odd and uninviting<br />
As a theme for rhyme or writing;<br />
Coinage of that dull Max M&uuml;ller,<br />
Title of a book still duller.<br />
Fill&rsquo;d with words so cabalistic,<br />
That methought the German mystic<br />
Must have found the dialect<br />
Spoken ere man walk&rsquo;d erect.</p>
<p class="poetry">Never mind! what must be, must;<br />

Is to make his <i>rhymes</i> suggestive.<br />
If in what you chance to seize on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhyme and reason will not chime,<br />
Better rhyme without the reason<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than the reason and no rhyme;<br />
Better anything than prose,<br />

<p class="poetry">Still I see no clue to chips!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Meadows where the lambkin skips,<br />
Where the dew from roses drips<br />
And the bee the honey sips . . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Odd, that nothing leads to chips!</p>
<p class="poetry">Then I thought of &ldquo;cranks and
quips,&rdquo;<br />
Wanton wiles and laughing lips,<br />
Luring us to fatal slips,<br />
And leaving us in Satan&rsquo;s grips.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then I made a desperate trial,<br />
With the sixth and seventh vial&mdash;<br />
Thinking I could steal some Chips<br />

<p class="poetry">Then there came a long hiatus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While I kept repeating Chips,<br />
Feeling the divine afflatus<br />

<p class="poetry">Gone and going hopelessly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So, in my accustom&rsquo;d manner,<br />

One at once, or all the Triad.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Lo! a voice to my invoking!<br />
&rsquo;Twas my stupid gardener croaking,<br />
&ldquo;Please, Sir, mayn&rsquo;t I fall this tree,<br />
&rsquo;Cos it spoils the crops, you see:<br />
<a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>And the
grass it shades and lumbers,<br />
And we shan&rsquo;t have no <i>cow</i>cumbers.<br />
Some time it will fall for good,<br />
And the Missis wants the wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Shock&rsquo;d at such a scheme audacious,<br />
Faint, I gasp&rsquo;d out, &ldquo;Goodness gracious!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the tree must fall,<br />
&rsquo;Tis, alas! the lot of all;<br />
But no mortal shall presume<br />
To accelerate its doom.<br />
Rescued from thy low desires,<br />
It shall warm my poet fires.<br />
Let the strokes of fate subdue it,<br />
Let the axe of Time cut through it;<br />
When it must fall, let it fall,<br />
But, oh! never let me view it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Seeing that my phrase exalted<br />
Fell upon his senses vainly,<br />
In my full career I halted,<br />
And I spoke my orders plainly.<br />
&ldquo;Never seek to trim or lop it,<br />
Once for all I charge thee, drop it.&rdquo;<br />
And I added, to my sorrow,<br />
&ldquo;You shall &lsquo;cut your stick&rsquo; to-morrow<br />
Know what <i>that</i> means, I suppose?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I thinks I does.&rdquo;<br />
So I left him at this crisis,<br />
Left him to his own devices,<br />
Left him like the royal Vandal,<br />
Leaning on his old spade handle.<br />
Oh! those vulgar slang expressions,&mdash;<br />
How I smart for my transgressions!<br />
<a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Judge my
wrath, surprise, and horror,<br />
When I rose upon the morrow,<br />
To behold my tree in ruin,<br />
And be told &rsquo;twas all <i>my</i> doing,<br />
While the villain grinn&rsquo;d in glee!<br />
&ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; I thunder&rsquo;d, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my
tree?&rdquo;<br />
And these words came from his lips,<br />
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the tree, and them&rsquo;s the
Chips.&rdquo;</p>

MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.</span></p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">You&rsquo;ve</span> heard
in Greek mythology<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of nymph and hamadryad<br />
Who had their being in a tree;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Perchance, the tale admired.<br />
Yet live we, in oblivion sunk;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though strange, my tale&rsquo;s as sure as<br />
That I was once a stately trunk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the forests of Honduras.</p>
<p class="poetry">My home was in a jungle low,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And tall tree ferns grew round me;<br />
The humming-birds flew to and fro,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wild lianas bound me;<br />
The panther, jaguar, and ounce,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lurk&rsquo;d ever in my branches<br />
On weary travellers to pounce<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While journeying to their ranches.<br />
Me, merchants from Honduras found<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who had not got a log any;<br />
They cut me prostrate on the ground<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To make first-rate mahogany.</p>
<p class="poetry">They pack&rsquo;d me in a darksome hold;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We cross&rsquo;d the ocean quivering;<br />
They took me to a region cold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That set my timbers shivering;<br />
<a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>Above, an
atmosphere of fog;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Around me, masts upstanding&mdash;<br />
When they had piled me log by log,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the dockyard landing.</p>
<p class="poetry">And then they came with rule and chalk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Numb&rsquo;ring my feet and inches,<br />
And pack&rsquo;d us high beside that walk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With pullies, cranks, and winches;<br />
And one by one my logs were sold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And one by one were taken,<br />
Till I, the spirit of the whole,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was left of form forsaken.</p>
<p class="poetry">And when the auction sale was past,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mourning each separate splinter<br />
I flitted formless round the masts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through all that ice-bound winter,<br />
Still with benumb&rsquo;d and torpid sense<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All plan or hope deferring,<br />
Till, when the spring sun shone intense,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My spirit&rsquo;s sap was stirring,</p>
<p class="poetry">I heard a wordless, whisper&rsquo;d sound,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Such as we tree-nymphs utter,)<br />
Of swelling twigs, and buds unbound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And tremulous leaflets&rsquo; flutter,&mdash;<br />
And saw a dim, green, glossy face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With eyes like pearly flowers,&mdash;<br />
And knew the spirit of our race,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fresh from Honduras&rsquo; bowers.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Poor disembodied nymph,&rdquo; I
thought<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Each splintering and chipling;<br />
Then, backwards to Honduras flown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou&rsquo;lt have another sapling.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">I wing&rsquo;d my way elate with hopes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To seek each cabinet maker&mdash;<br />
To Druse and Heal&rsquo;s well furnish&rsquo;d shops,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Bazaar of Baker&mdash;<br />
Each piano manufactory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Broadwood and to Collard&mdash;<br />
Where&rsquo;er a portion of my tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was carried, there I follow&rsquo;d:</p>
<p class="poetry">And where&rsquo;er a sofa or chair I saw,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or bedstead or wardrobe furnish&rsquo;d,<br />
Or centre-table with spreading claw,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With my wood all brightly burnish&rsquo;d,<br />
Each knot, and knob, and scar, and split,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And delicate grain appearing.<br />
Long was my search, made longer yet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the general use of veneering.</p>
<p class="poetry">I&rsquo;ve flitted through a mansion proud<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To watch a grand piano,<br />
The centre of a list&rsquo;ning crowd<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; High-bred in tone and manner:<br />
I&rsquo;ve stood by many a shining board,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were dinners were demolish&rsquo;d,<br />
And view&rsquo;d the silver and glass <i>encored</i>&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seen double in the polish.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>And beside a stately bed I&rsquo;ve stood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where curtains of silken splendour<br />
O&rsquo;er damask hangings and polish&rsquo;d wood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Threw a lustre subdued and tender.<br />
A dainty cradle stood near its head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But no form was in it sleeping,<br />
For the couch of state held the baby dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the mother knelt near it weeping:</p>
<p class="poetry">I came beneath a gorgeous dome,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With fretted arch and column,<br />
And stained glass windows through the gloom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That made it very solemn.<br />
And by the pulpit stairs I stood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The preacher&rsquo;s words to follow&mdash;<br />
The sounding-board was my own wood&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (That, and the words were hollow):</p>
<p class="poetry">And I&rsquo;ve wandered to the
library&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bookshelves there were mine&mdash;<br />
Belonging to one of the Ministry;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole was wondrous fine.<br />
(I thought the pay seem&rsquo;d very high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The work of an easy nature,<br />
And wondered if that was the reason why<br />
They would not suffer women to try<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To sit in the Legislature):</p>
<p class="poetry">And I&rsquo;ve been up a dismal attic
flight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not knowing why there I hasten&rsquo;d,<br />
And I found &rsquo;twas the sewing-table bright<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To which a machine was fasten&rsquo;d;<br />
And a girl was working, so pale and drear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>And in such a forlorn condition,<br />
That, ghost as I was, I had shed a tear,<br />
But I knew that that garret was woman&rsquo;s sphere,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dressmaking her mission.</p>
<p class="poetry">Last month I came to a table round<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which cover&rsquo;d, to my surprise, is,<br />
(Whilst a critical crowd collects around,)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With chips of all lengths and sizes:<br />
And I knew I&rsquo;d found the last piece of wood;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And back, to my former station,<br />
My spirit crossed the Atlantic flood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin a new transformation.<br />
So I laid the glimpses that I had had<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the motley life of this nation<br />
Upon this table&mdash;or good or bad&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the general delectation.</p>

67</span>TRANSFORMATION.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.</span></h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> fisherman walked
up the hill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His boat lay on the sand,<br />
His net was on his shoulder still,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His home a mile inland.<br />
And as he walk&rsquo;d among the whin<br />
He saw a little white seal-skin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which he took up in his hand.<br />
Then &ldquo;How,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;can this thing be?<br />
A seal-skin, and no seal within?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus pondered
he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partly in
fear,<br />
Till he remember&rsquo;d what he&rsquo;d heard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of creatures in the sea,&mdash;<br />
Sea-men and women, who are stirred<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One day in every year<br />
To drop their seal-skins on the sand,<br />
To leave the sea, and seek the land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For twelve long hours,<br />
Playing about in sweet sunshine,<br />
Among the corn-fields, with corn-flowers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wild roses, and woodbine:<br />
Till night comes on, and then they flit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Adown the fields, and sit<br />
Upon the shore and put their seal-skins on,<br />
And slip into the sea, and they are gone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>The fisherman strok&rsquo;d the fur<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the little white seal-skin,<br />
Soft as silk, and white as snow;<br />
And he said to himself, &ldquo;I know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That some little sea-woman lived in<br />
This seal-skin, perhaps not long ago.<br />
I wonder what has become of her!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And why she left this on the whin,<br />
Instead of slipping it on again<br />
When all the little sea-women and men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Went hurrying down to the sea!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah! well, she never meant<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It for me,<br />
That I should take it, but I will,<br />
Home to my house on the hill,&rdquo;<br />
Said the fisherman; and home he went.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Fisher dozed before his fire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The night was cold outside,<br />
The bright full moon was rising higher<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the swelling tide,<br />
And the wind brought the sound of breakers nigher,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Even to the hill side;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When suddenly<br />
Something broke at the cottage door,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Like the plash<br />
Of a little wave on a pebbly shore;<br />
And as water frets in the backward drain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the wave, seeming to fall in pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There came a wailing after the plash.&mdash;<br />
The fisherman woke, and said, &ldquo;Is it rain?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he rose from his seat<br />
And open&rsquo;d his door a little way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But soon shut it again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>With a kind of awe;<br />
For the prettiest little sea-woman lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the grass at his feet<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That you ever saw;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She began to sob and to say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who has stolen my skin from me?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And who is there will take me in?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For I have lost my little seal-skin,<br />
And I can&rsquo;t get back to the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The Fisherman stroked the fur<br />
Of the downy white seal-skin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he said, &ldquo;Shall I give it her?&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But then she would get in,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hurry away to the sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And not come back to me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I should be sorry all my life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I want her so for my little wife.&rdquo;<br />
The Fisherman thought for a minute,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he carried the seal-skin to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A secret hole in
the thatch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where he hid it cleverly, so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That a sharp-sighted person might go,<br />
In front of the hole and not catch<br />
A glimpse of the seal-skin within it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; After this he lifted the latch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of his door once more,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the night was darker, for<br
/>
The moon was swimming under a cloud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the Fisherman couldn&rsquo;t
see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The little sea-woman plainly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing a fleck of white foam only,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was sobbing aloud<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As before.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>&ldquo;Little sea-woman,&rdquo; said the Fisherman,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you come home to me,<br />
Will you help me to work, and help me to save,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Care for my house and me,<br />
And the little children that we shall have?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, Fisherman,&rdquo; said she.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So the Fisherman had his way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And seven years of life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&rsquo;d by him like one happy day;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, as for his sea-wife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She sorrowed for the sea alway<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And loved not her land life.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Morning and evening, and all day<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
She would say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To herself&mdash;&ldquo;The sea!
the sea!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And at night, when dreaming,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She stretch&rsquo;d her arms about her, seeming<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To seek little Willie,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was the sea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She would have clasp&rsquo;d, not
he&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The great sea&rsquo;s purple
water,<br />
Dearer to her than little son or daughter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet she was
kind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To her children three,<br />
Harry, fair Alice, and baby Willie;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And set her
mind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To keep things orderly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Only,&rdquo; thought she,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;If I <i>could</i> but find<br />
That little seal-skin I lost one day.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t
know<br />
That her husband had it hidden away;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor he<br />
That she long&rsquo;d for it so.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Until<br
/>
One evening as he climb&rsquo;d the hill,<br />
The Fisherman found her amongst the whin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sobbing, saying, &ldquo;My little
seal-skin&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who has stolen
my skin from me?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How shall I find it, and get in,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hurry away
to the sea?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then she
shall have her will,&rdquo;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Said he.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So<br
/>
Next morning, when he rose to go<br />
A-fishing, and his wife still slept,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He stole<br />
The seal-skin from that secret hole<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where he had kept<br />
It, and flung it on a chair,<br />
Saying, &ldquo;She will be glad to find it there<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To-day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am gone,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And yet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps she will not put it on,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;Nor go away.&rdquo;<br />
In sleeping his wife wept;<br />
Then the Fisherman took his net<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And crept<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the chill air.</p>
<p class="poetry">The night drew on&mdash;the air was still,<br
/>
Homeward the fisher climbed the hill.<br />
All day he&rsquo;d thought, &ldquo;She will not go;&rdquo;<br />
And now, &ldquo;She has not,&rdquo; pondered he.<br />
&ldquo;She is not gone,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know,<br />
There is a lamp in our window,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Put ready on the sill<br />
<a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>To guide
me home, and I shall see<br />
The dear light glimmering presently,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as I round the hill.&rdquo;<br />
But when he turn&rsquo;d, there was no light<br />
To guide him homeward through the night.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, &ldquo;I am late,&rdquo; he said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;And maybe she was weary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking so long for me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She lays the little ones in bed<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well content,<br />
In the inner room where I shall find her,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And where she went,<br />
Forgetting to leave the light behind her.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he came to his cottage
door,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And threw it open wide;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But stood a breathing space, before<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He dared to look inside.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No fire was in the fireplace, nor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A light on any side;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But a little heap lay on the floor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the voice of a baby cried.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rocking and moaning on the floor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That little
heap<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the children, tired with crying,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trying to
sleep,<br />
Moaning and rocking to and fro;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But Baby Willie hindered the trying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By wailing
so.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then &ldquo;Wife! wife!&rdquo; said the
Fisherman,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come from the inner room.&rdquo;<br />
There was no answer, and he ran<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Searching into the gloom.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>&ldquo;Wife! wife! why don&rsquo;t you come?<br />
The children want you, and I&rsquo;ve come home.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mammy&rsquo;s gone, Daddy,&rdquo; said
Harry&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gone into the sea;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll never come back to carry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tired Baby Willie.<br />
It&rsquo;s no use now, Daddy, looking about;<br />
I can tell you just how it all fell out.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There
was a seal-skin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the kitchen&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little crumpled thing;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think how it came there;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this
morning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mammy found it on a chair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when she began<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To feel it, she dropped<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It on the
floor&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But snatch&rsquo;d it up again and
ran<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Straight out at the door,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And never
stopped<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till she-reach&rsquo;d the
shore.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Then we three,
Daddy,<br />
Ran after, crying, &lsquo;Take us to the sea!<br />
Wait for us, Mammy, we are coming too!<br />
Here&rsquo;s Alice, Willie can&rsquo;t keep up with you!<br />
Mammy, stop&mdash;just for a minute or two!&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But Alice said, &lsquo;Maybe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She&rsquo;s making us a boat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the seal-skin cleverly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And by-and-by she&rsquo;ll
float<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It on the water from the sands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For us.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then Willie clapt his hands<br
/>
<a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>And
shouted, &lsquo;Run on, Mammy, to the sea,<br />
And we are coming, Willie understands.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;At last we came to where the hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Slopes straight down to the beach,<br />
And there we stood all breathless, still,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fast clinging each to each.<br />
We saw her sitting upon a stone,<br />
Putting the little seal-skin on.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Mammy!&nbsp; Mammy!<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; She never said good-bye, Daddy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t kiss us three;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; She just put the little seal-skin on,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And slipped into the sea!<br />

Kiss her! and leave her!&mdash;thy love is clay!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">They smoothed her tresses of dark brown

On her forehead of stone they laid it fair:</p>
<p class="poetry">Over her eyes, which gazed too much,<br />
They drew the lids with a gentle touch;</p>
<p class="poetry">With a tender touch they closed up well<br />
The sweet thin lips that had secrets to tell;</p>

They tied her veil and her marriage-lace;</p>
<p class="poetry">And drew on her white feet her white silk

But the Silence&mdash;and scents of eglantere,</p>
<p class="poetry">And jasmine, and roses, and rosemary;<br />
For they said, &ldquo;As a lady should lie, lies she!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">And they held their breath as they left the

With a shudder to glance at its stillness and gloom.</p>
<p class="poetry">But he&mdash;who loved her too well to dread<br

The sweet, the stately, the beautiful dead,&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>THE
GLOAMING.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> gloaming! the gloaming!&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is the gloaming?&rdquo; was asked by some honourable
member of this honourable Society, when the word was chosen a
month ago.&nbsp; &ldquo;Twilight,&rdquo; was promptly answered by
another honourable member!&nbsp; And although the gloaming is
undoubtedly <i>twilight</i>, is twilight as undoubtedly the
gloaming?&mdash;the gloaming of Burns, of Scott, the gloaming so
often referred to in our old Northern minstrelsy?&nbsp; The City
clerk on the knife-board of his familiar &ldquo;bus,&rdquo;
soothing himself with a fragrant Pickwick, after his ten
hours&rsquo; labour in that turmoil and eddy of restless
humanity&mdash;the City&mdash;may see, as he rolls westward, the
sun slowly sinking and setting in its fiery grandeur behind the
Marble Arch.&nbsp; He may see the shades of evening stealing over
the Park and the Bayswater Road, and darkness settling softly
over gentle Notting Hill; and he may see, if there be no fog, or
not too much smoke in the atmosphere to prevent astronomical
observations, the stars stealing out one by one in the Heavens
above him, as the gas-lamps are being lit in the streets around
him; but would that observant youth on his knife-board, with his
Pickwick, amidst the lamp-lights, in the roar of London, be
justified in describing what he had seen as &ldquo;the
gloaming?&rdquo;&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; Is not the gloaming
twilight only in certain localities, and under certain
conditions?&nbsp; Is not the gloaming chiefly confined to the
North country, or to mountainous districts?&nbsp; It is difficult
to say where the <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>gloaming shall be called gloaming no more, and where
twilight is just simple twilight, and no gloaming; but surely
there lives not the man who will assert that he has seen a real
gloaming effect in the <i>Tottenham Court Road</i>, for
instance!</p>
<p>Can it be applied to eventide in the flat fens of Lincolnshire
and Cambridgeshire?&nbsp; Does the gloaming ever fall on the
manufacturing districts of Yorkshire&mdash;Leeds, Sheffield,
Huddersfield?&nbsp; Twilight in the Potteries is surely twilight
and no gloaming.&nbsp; May not, are not the limits within which
the latter word may be used as aptly describing eventide, be the
limits within which our old balladry sprung and flourished?&nbsp;
May not, are not the limits within which the word is wholly
inapplicable to describe the close of day, be the limits within
which the love of song was not so strongly developed&mdash;where
external nature did not, and does not suggest song, or poetry to
the mind?&nbsp; Well, that definition is quite enough for the
present day, in which &ldquo;hard and fast lines&rdquo; are at a
discount!&nbsp; But there is still that awkward question,
&ldquo;What is the gloaming?&rdquo;&nbsp; And what is there in
the gloaming that distinguishes it from that which is twilight
merely?&nbsp; To answer that with any hope of conveying any sense
of the difference which undoubtedly <i>does</i> exist, is a
matter which is beyond the capacity of any one not being a
Ruskin.&nbsp; As to <i>define</i> the gloaming is beyond the
powers of ordinary mortals, and as ostracism is threatened if I
do not do something&mdash;as I am writing <i>in terrorem</i>, and
to save my pen-and-pencil existence, which is hanging on this
slender thread&mdash;I will, in default of being able to do
better, give my own experiences of a real &ldquo;<span
class="GutSmall">GLOAMING</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Time of year&mdash;the end of August.&nbsp; Locality,
<i>not</i> the Tottenham Court Road, but one of the northernmost
<a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>points of
the Northumberland border&mdash;a wild, rough, hard
land&mdash;the fighting ground, for centuries upon centuries,
first of the old Romans, and then of our own border laddies, who
held it against the &ldquo;rieving Scots&rdquo;&mdash;a land over
which the famous Sixth Legion has marched&mdash;a land which has
seen Hotspur fight and Douglas fall&mdash;a land where almost
every hillside and burn has its legend and ballad&mdash;a land on
which one would reasonably expect to see the gloaming, as
distinguished from twilight, fall!&nbsp; I had had ten days
walking after wild grouse&mdash;tramping through the heather,
generally dripping wet, for the Scotch mist did not observe or
keep the border line, worse luck to it.&nbsp; At last a fine day,
and a long tramp on the moors.&nbsp; At the close of it, having
first walked enough over the soft moss and young heather to make
me exult in the grand condition for exercise which ten
days&rsquo; hill air will give, I separated from my party to try
for a snipe down by a little tarn, lying in the midst of a
&ldquo;faded bent&rdquo; in the moor, intending to tramp home
afterwards in my own company&mdash;and in my own company it
<i>was</i> that I had full opportunity of studying the effect of
the gloaming.</p>
<p>The sun was getting low as I separated from my party and
walked up the side of a long hill covered with old heather, moss,
patches of grass, patches of reeds, and bogs.&nbsp; It was a
glorious scene!&nbsp; A sea of moorland&mdash;wave over wave of
undulating hill&mdash;rolled from me northward to the foot of old
Cheviot, whose long back, some twenty miles away, was lit up by
the brilliant sinking sun so clearly that I could distinguish the
gullies and inequalities in its time-honoured old sides.&nbsp;
Wave over wave, southward and westward, rolled those same
moorland hills from my feet, seemingly into the still more
distant hills of Cumberland, and from north to south, east to
west, was a sea of <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>purple heather in its fullest bloom, lit up by the
golden floods of light of the setting sun.&nbsp; In another five
minutes the sun had disappeared, and I was down by the side of
the little Tarn.&nbsp; Already the air, always fresh on the
hills, became fresher; the golden light was dying out of the sky;
the blue of the Heaven above me was darkening, the hills, a mass
of purple sheen so few minutes ago, stood out sharp and black
against the sky; and so I started on my long tramp home, watching
the growth of the &ldquo;gloaming.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was still
the heather.&nbsp; I was still tramping through it, but its
colour was gone.&nbsp; It was now an expanse of purple
blackness.&nbsp; More intensely dark became the blue of the sky
above me as the red streaks, still hovering over the place where
the sun had dipped, faded.&nbsp; Gradually, imperceptibly was
darkness spreading over everything; and as the darkness spread,
the stillness and sweetness of the &ldquo;gloaming&rdquo; made
itself felt.&nbsp; The stillness and freshness of the air, the
mysterious blackness of the hills; the startling white flashes of
the little pools, in the moors, looking as though they had
absorbed light from somewhere, and were loth to part with it; the
faintly reflected colours of the fading sky given back by the
burns and streamlets which crossed my path, the whispering of the
reeds and long grass; the great grey boulders looming here and
there through the dark heather and bracken&mdash;boulders behind
which at that hour one could not help believing that Kelpies and
Pixies were hiding, and might dart out at any moment for some
Tam-o&rsquo;-Shanter frolic over the moor&mdash;and the soft
springy moss, grass, and heather, still under my feet deadening
all the sound of my tread.&nbsp; Light dying, fading, and
darkness, a rich purple darkness, spreading; and everywhere the
scent of heather bloom and stillness and
freshness&mdash;freshness indescribable, a stillness only broken
by the <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>call here and there of the scattered grouse; or the soft
rush of wings and whistling of golden plover far away over head;
or the cry of the lapwing&mdash;or the bark miles away of a
collie dog; or the dripping and murmuring and bubbling of the
little burns in the gullies!</p>
<p>Light still dying away!&nbsp; What was left only &ldquo;dealt
a doubtful sense of things not so much seen as felt.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then it was that I realized what Robert Burns had
sung:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Gie me the hour o&rsquo; gloamin grey,<br
/>
For it mak&rsquo;s my heart sae cheery O.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">There</span>!&nbsp; I have finished
my sketch of the sloping field, and the misty strip of woodland
above, in its autumn dress, by putting you in in the foreground,
the only living thing in my misty-autumn picture; though, after
all, you don&rsquo;t look much more than a brown spot on the
green, with your brown hat and skirt and your old brown
book.&nbsp; I am much obliged to it for keeping you still so long
this misty morning.&nbsp; What is there in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sketches,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Misty
sketches like this of yours.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I stretched out my
hand for my cousin&rsquo;s drawing, while she looked over my
shoulder down on to the volume on my knee and uttered an
exclamation of surprise when her eye fell on nothing but black
letters on a damp spotted yellow page.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Treating of the four complexions, into which men
are bound during their sojourn in their earthly
houses,&rsquo;&rdquo; she read aloud; &ldquo;what does it
mean?&nbsp; Let me look on.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of those that draw their
complexion from the dark and melancholy earth.&nbsp; Of those who
take their complexion from the friendly air.&nbsp; Of those who
are complexioned after the manner of fire.&nbsp; Of those who
partake of the nature of the subtle and yielding water;&rsquo;
who writes this queer stuff; is it sense or
nonsense?&rdquo;&nbsp; I held up the book that she might read the
faded gilt letters on its wormeaten leather back.&nbsp; <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>&ldquo;Letters of Jacob B&ouml;hme to John Schauffman
and others,&rdquo; she read.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&mdash;rather
a doubtful &ldquo;oh!&rdquo; it was, as if the name did not
settle the question about sense or nonsense as completely as she
had expected it would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is rather a rare book I flatter myself,&rdquo; I
went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I bought it at a book-stall because it
looked so odd and old, and found to my great joy that it was a
miscellaneous collection of Jacob B&ouml;hme&rsquo;s letters, on
all sorts of subjects; the four that I have been reading this
morning about the four different temperaments, or, as he calls
it, complexions into which men may be divided, come in oddly
enough among much more mystical and transcendental matter.&nbsp;
They are, as I said, misty sketches of character, but I think
they show that the dreamy old cobbler knew something about his
fellow-men.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>K.</i>&nbsp; &ldquo;What are Jacob B&ouml;hme&rsquo;s
writings like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t tell you that, I can only tell you
what it makes one feel like to read them.&nbsp; Something, as we
should feel, you and I, if we climbed up to that peak above the
wood there, and looked down on the mist in the valley now the sun
is gilding it.&nbsp; We should have a vague feeling of having got
up on to a height, and perceived something glorious; but we
should not be able to give much account of what we had seen when
we came down.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>K.</i>&nbsp; &ldquo;But I hope you will be able to give me
an account of what you have been reading to-day.&nbsp; I want you
to explain to me about the four complexions as we walk
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I will try; these four letters have something in
them that one can get hold of and venture to put into fresh
words.&nbsp; You must remember, to begin with, that B&ouml;hme
still held to there being only four elements&mdash;earth, air,
fire, and water&mdash;and thought that everything, our <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>bodies
included, was made up of various proportions of these elemental
substances&mdash;the soul, a pure indivisible essence, he thinks
of as living imprisoned in these compound bodies.&nbsp; Shadowed
and clouded and hindered in its work by the material form that
shuts it in from the true fount of being; individualizing it and
debasing it at the same time.&nbsp; Character, according to him,
depends upon the element that preponderates in the composition of
our bodies; our souls work through it and are more or less
free.&nbsp; His theory of the causes of differences of character
may be ever so foolish, yet I think the classification he draws
from it is interesting, and does somehow or other help us to
understand ourselves and our fellow-creatures a little
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>K.</i>&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me see, he divides people into
earth, air, fire, and water people.&nbsp; What sort of character
does he suppose the earth element colours the soul
with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right to use the word <i>colour</i>,
B&ouml;hme thinks of the complexion, or, as we should say, the
humour of a person, as of an independent <i>atmosphere</i>
through which the soul works, but which is no part of it.&nbsp;
He speaks of souls shut up in the dark and melancholy earth
element; these are the silent, sensitive, brooding people, who
find it very difficult either to give out or receive impressions
to or from their fellow-creatures.&nbsp; They are shut up, and as
the earth (so at least B&ouml;hme says) draws a great deal more
heat and light from the sun than it ever gives back, and darkly
absorbs and stores up heat within itself, so these earth men and
women, separated from their fellows, have the power of drawing
great enlightenment and deep warmth of love <i>direct</i> from
the spiritual source of light and love.&nbsp; Religious
enthusiasts are all of this class; B&ouml;hme was an earth person
himself, he says so; so was Dante and John Bunyan, and all the
other people one <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>reads of who have had terrible experiences in the depths
of their own souls and ecstatic visions to comfort them.&nbsp;
B&ouml;hme says that the very best and the very worst people are
those shut in by the earth.&nbsp; They are the most
<i>individual</i>, the most thoroughly separated; if conquering
this hindrance, they re-absorb the Divine into themselves by
<i>direct</i> vision; they rise to heights of wisdom, love, and
self-sacrifice that no other souls can reach; but if by pride and
self-will they cut themselves from spiritual influences, they
remain solitary, dark, hungry, always striving vainly to extract
the light and warmth they want from some one or two of their
fellow-creatures, and being constantly disappointed, because, not
having the power of ray-ing out love, they can rarely attract
it.&nbsp; They are eaten up by a sad dark egotism.&nbsp; If they
have a great deal of intellect they throw themselves vehemently
into some one pursuit or study, and become great but never
happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>K.</i>&nbsp; &ldquo;I am thankful to say I don&rsquo;t know
any earth people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor do I, pure earth, but I think I have come across
one or two with a touch of earth in their temperaments.&nbsp; The
air folk are much more common.&nbsp; They are the eager
inquisitive people, who want to get into everything and
understand everything, just as the air pervades and permeates all
creation.&nbsp; Great lovers of knowledge and scientific
observers must always be air people.&nbsp; B&ouml;hme thinks that
in spite of their not being generally very spiritual, they have
the best chance of getting to heaven, because of all classes they
have most sympathy and are least shut up in themselves, getting
everywhere, like their element the air: they get into the souls
of others and understand them and live in them.&nbsp; Their
influence is of a very peculiar kind; not being very individual,
they don&rsquo;t impress the people round them with a strong
sense of <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>their personality; they are not loved passionately, and
they don&rsquo;t love passionately, but people turn to them to be
understood and helped, and they are always benevolently ready to
understand and help.&nbsp; They are satisfied that their
influence should be breathed like the air, without being more
recognized than the air: Shakespeare was, I expect, a typical
<i>air</i> man.&nbsp; He had been everywhere, into all sorts of
souls, peering about, and understanding them all, and how little
any one seems to have known about himself!&nbsp; He was separated
as little as possible from the universal fount of
Being.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>K.</i>&nbsp; &ldquo;Socrates was an air man too I
suppose?&nbsp; Your air people would be all
philosophers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More or less lovers of knowledge they must be; but
remember that temperament does not affect the quality of the soul
itself, it is only more or less of a hindrance.&nbsp; The
peculiar faults of air people are, as you will imagine,
fickleness and coldness; their sympathy partakes of the nature of
curiosity, and they easily adapt themselves to changes of
circumstance; they can as easily live in one person as in
another, and the love of knowledge in little souls would
degenerate into restless curiosity and fussiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>K.</i>&nbsp; &ldquo;Would not Goethe be as good a type of
the air temperament as Shakespeare?&nbsp; He certainly had the
besetting faults of the complexion, fickleness and
coldness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the great influence he exercised over his
contemporaries, points to his drawing something too from the fire
nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>K.</i>&nbsp; &ldquo;Those complexioned after the manner of
the fire are, I suppose, the warm-hearted, affectionate
souls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all; B&ouml;hme would not have consented to lay
hold of such an obvious analogy.&nbsp; He dives deeper into fire
characteristics than to think chiefly of its warmth.&nbsp; <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>It is above
all a consuming element; it takes substances of all kinds and
transmutes them into itself, a greedy devourer, reckless of the
value of what it takes, intent only on increasing and maintaining
itself.&nbsp; The fire people are the ambitious conquerors and
rulers of the world, who by the strength and attractive warmth of
their own natures force others to bend to them and become
absorbed in their projects.&nbsp; They are in reality as great
egotists as the earth people, only they don&rsquo;t keep their
egotism at smouldering fever heat in their own hearts; they let
it blaze forth into a living flame, which draws weaker natures to
be consumed in it, or at least forces them to live only in its
heat and light.&nbsp; Napoleon Bonaparte, I think, might stand
for a typical fire man.&nbsp; In women the fire nature shows
rather differently: pure fire women have acted very conspicuous
parts in the world&rsquo;s history, and generally very disastrous
ones, they are the women who inspire great passions and feel very
little themselves.&nbsp; They draw others to them for the sake of
homage to add to their own light.&nbsp; Madame de Chevreuse and
Madame de Longueville must have been pure fire women, I should
say.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t suppose, however, that the fire, more than
any other temperament, secures greatness or real superiority; it
enables those who follow its complexion to impress themselves
more on other people than the air spirits can, but their
influence may be only temporary, and it may be very disagreeable,
and in the end repelling.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know people, both
men and women, who have a mysterious way of making their will
felt, and who always count for something in whatever society they
are in as long as they are present, but who leave no permanent
impression?&nbsp; Those I suppose would be, according to
B&ouml;hme, stupid souls acting through the fire
temperament.&nbsp; The influence of the air souls, inconspicuous
<a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>as it is,
is more permanent.&nbsp; Like the air it nourishes and changes
without destroying; air people give more than they take.&nbsp;
Fire people take more than they give.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>K.</i>&nbsp; &ldquo;And now what are the water
followers?&nbsp; I hope we are coming to some amiable, pleasant
people at last, for you have not described anything very
attractive yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you will like the water complexion least of
all, and be obliged to acknowledge too that &lsquo;the subtle and
yielding water&rsquo; has more followers than any of the other
elements.&nbsp; The water element has a sort of resemblance to
the air element; it mimics it without having its power.&nbsp;
Water people are that large majority of mankind who have too weak
a hold on life to be anything very distinctive of
themselves.&nbsp; They simulate living and thinking, rather than
really think and live.&nbsp; Just as water receives impressions
in itself that it cannot clasp and hold, that seem to be part of
it and are not.&nbsp; They are easily influenced by
others&mdash;by air people for example; but they only
<i>image</i> their thoughts in themselves.&nbsp; They look like
them when they are with them, and when the influence is removed
they are empty like a lake when a veil of clouds is drawn over
the sky.&nbsp; The distinctive mark of water people is that they
are <i>self-conscious</i>, they are always thinking of
themselves, because they live a sort of double
life&mdash;occupied not only with what they are doing but with
the thought that they actually are doing it.&nbsp; Unconsciously
they are continually acting a part.&nbsp; They have notions about
themselves and act up to them.&nbsp; They see themselves in
different lights, and everything else as it concerns
themselves.&nbsp; Seeing not the real thing, but the thing
reflected in themselves.&nbsp; You must know such people, though
they are difficult to describe, and I cannot just now think of
any historical typical water person to help out my
description.&nbsp; Perhaps <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>Napoleon the Third would do.&nbsp; I
think he must be what B&ouml;hme meant by &lsquo;those who
partake of the nature of the subtle and yielding nature;&rsquo;
and, by the way, B&ouml;hme does not describe the water people as
really yielding; on the contrary, he says they are very
persistent.&nbsp; In a slow, obstinate way, by seeming to yield
and always returning to the point from which they had been
diverging (always finding their own level) they have more power
than the followers of any of the other elements.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>K.</i>&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there nothing good about these poor
water creatures?&nbsp; Have they no redeeming
qualities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes!&nbsp; The water temperament conduces to
industry and perseverance.&nbsp; Water men and women are very
good imitators, not actors, and do most of the second-rate work
in the world.&nbsp; They are not un-sympathizing.&nbsp; Like air
people, they take in easily the thoughts and lives of others,
only they are always conscious of taking them in; they
don&rsquo;t lose themselves in others, as it is possible for the
air followers to do.&nbsp; While they sympathize, they think how
nice it is to be sympathetic; or, if they are women, perhaps the
thought is how interesting I look while I am listening to this
sad story.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>K.</i>&nbsp; &ldquo;Come now, I believe you have some
particular water person in your mind, for you are getting
satirical.&nbsp; It is well we are nearly home.&nbsp; What I
can&rsquo;t understand is, why all the four complexions have so
much that is disagreeable in them.&nbsp; In which class would
B&ouml;hme put really good and noble people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might come into any one of the four classes.&nbsp;
You must remember that according to B&ouml;hme the temperament is
an outer material atmosphere surrounding the soul, and of
necessity partly evil, because it is material; the pure soul has
to work through it, and conquer it, according to
B&ouml;hme.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>I.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Sir</span> <span
class="GutSmall">POET</span>, ere you crossed the lawn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (If it was wrong to watch you, pardon)<br />
Behind this weeping birch withdrawn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I watched you saunter round the garden.<br />
I saw you bend beside the phlox;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pluck, as you passed, a sprig of myrtle,<br />
Review my well-ranged hollyhocks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Smile at the fountain&rsquo;s slender spurtle;</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p class="poetry">You paused beneath the cherry-tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where my marauder thrush was singing,<br />
Peered at the bee-hives curiously,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And narrowly escaped a stinging;<br />
And then&mdash;you see I watched&mdash;you passed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Down the espalier walk that reaches<br />
Out to the western wall, and last<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dropped on the seat before the peaches.</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p class="poetry">What was your thought?&nbsp; You waited
long.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sublime or graceful,&mdash;grave,&mdash;satiric?<br
/>
A Morris Greek-and-Gothic song?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A tender Tennysonian lyric?<br />
<a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Tell
me.&nbsp; That garden-seat shall be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So long as speech renown disperses,<br />
Illustrious as the spot where he&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The gifted Blank&mdash;composed his verses.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Poet</span>.<br />
IV.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Madam,&mdash;whose uncensorious eye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grows gracious over certain pages.<br />
Wherein the Jester&rsquo;s maxims lie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be, thicker than the Sage&rsquo;s<br />
I hear but to obey, and could<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mere wish of mine the pleasure do you,<br />
Some verse as whimsical as Hood,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As gay as Praed,&mdash;should answer to you.</p>
<h3>V.</h3>
<p class="poetry">But, though the common voice proclaims<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our only serious vocation<br />
Confined to giving nothings names,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dreams a &ldquo;local habitation;&rdquo;<br />
Believe me, there are tuneless days,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When neither marble, brass, nor vellum,<br />
Would profit much by any lays<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That haunt the poet&rsquo;s cerebellum.</p>
<h3>VI.</h3>
<p class="poetry">More empty things, I fear, than rhymes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More idle things than songs, absorb it;<br />
The &ldquo;finely-frenzied&rdquo; eye, at times,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reposes mildly in its orbit;<br />
<a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>And,
painful truth, at times, to him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose jog-trot thought is nowise restive,<br />
&ldquo;A primrose by a river&rsquo;s brim&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is absolutely unsuggestive.</p>
<h3>VII.</h3>
<p class="poetry">The fickle Muse!&nbsp; As ladies will,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She sometimes wearies of her wooer;<br />
A goddess, yet a woman still,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She flies the more that we pursue her;<br />
In short, with worst as well as best,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Five months in six, your hapless poet<br />
Is just as prosy as the rest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But cannot comfortably show it.</p>
<h3>VIII.</h3>
<p class="poetry">You thought, no doubt, the garden-scent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brings back some brief-winged bright sensation<br />
Of love that came and love that went,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some fragrance of a lost flirtation,<br />
Born when the cuckoo changes song,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dead ere the apple&rsquo;s red is on it,<br />
That should have been an epic long,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet scarcely served to fill a sonnet.</p>
<h3>IX.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Or else you thought,&mdash;the murmuring
noon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He turns it to a lyric sweeter,<br />
With birds that gossip in the tune,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And windy bough-swing in the metre;<br />
Or else the zigzag fruit-tree arms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Recall some dream of harp-prest bosoms,<br />
Round singing mouths, and chanted charms,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And medi&aelig;val orchard blossoms,&mdash;</p>
<h3><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p class="poetry">Quite <i>&agrave; la mode</i>.&nbsp; Alas! for
prose,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My vagrant fancies only rambled<br />
Back to the red-walled Rectory close,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where first my graceless boyhood gambolled,<br />
Climbed on the dial, teased the fish,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And chased the kitten round the beeches,<br />
Till widening instincts made me wish<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For certain slowly-ripening peaches.</p>
<h3>XI.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Three peaches.&nbsp; Not the Graces three<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had more equality of beauty:<br />
I would not look, yet went to see;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I wrestled with Desire and Duty;<br />
I felt the pangs of those who feel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Laws of Property beset them;<br />
The conflict made my reason reel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, half-abstractedly, I ate them;&mdash;</p>
<h3>XII.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Or Two of them.&nbsp; Forthwith
Despair&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More keen than one of these was rotten&mdash;<br />
Moved me to seek some forest lair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where I might hide and dwell forgotten,<br />
Attired in skins, by berries stained,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolved from brushes and ablution;&mdash;<br />
But, ere my sylvan haunt was gained,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fate gave me up to execution.</p>
<h3>XIII.</h3>
<p class="poetry">I saw it all but now.&nbsp; The grin<br />

scholar-like and thin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unroused, the tenderest of creatures;<br />

GONE BY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Is</span> it that things go by, or is it
that people go by the things?&nbsp; If the former, it is no
wonder that a good deal of gloom hangs about the matter.&nbsp; To
be standing still, and to have a panorama constantly moving by
one, bearing on its face all things fair and
beautiful&mdash;happy love scenes, kindly friends, pleasant
meetings, wise speeches, noble acts, stirring words, national
epochs, as well as gay landscapes of hill and dale, and river and
sun, and shade and trees, and cottages and labouring men and
grazing cattle; to have all things moving by one, and oneself to
stagnate and alone to be left behind, as all else moves on to
greet the young, the hopeful, and the untried,&mdash;there is
indeed something sad in this.&nbsp; We have seen these good and
beautiful and soul-touching visions once.&nbsp; They charmed and
entranced us as they lingered with us for a few brief and
blissful moments, but they have gone by and left us alone.&nbsp;
We shall never look upon them again.&nbsp; Yes, it is
bitter&mdash;too bitter almost for man to dwell upon much.&nbsp;
He must turn elsewhere, and try to bury the past in
forgetfulness, gazing on the new visions as they in turn pass by
him, knowing that their time is short, and that they too, like
all the old ones, will very soon be as though they were not.</p>
<p>But it is not so.&nbsp; Man is passing the world by, and not
the world man.&nbsp; Man is passing on, year after year, in his
magnificent and irresistible course, never losing, and ever
gaining.&nbsp; All he sees, and knows, and feels, and <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>does becomes
an inseparable part of himself, far more closely bound up with
his life and nature than even his flesh, and nerves, and
bones.&nbsp; It is not merely that he remembers the past and
loves the past, but he is the past; and he is more the whole
assembly of the past than he is anything else whatever.&nbsp; Man
alone moves onward to perfection and to happiness, as a universe
stands still ministering to his lordly progress.&nbsp; Even the
life, the passions, and the personal progress of each particular
man stand still, as it were, in the service of all the rest, and
become their lasting and inalienable treasure.&nbsp; Nothing is
wasted or irreparable but wrong-doing, and that too is not
lost.</p>
<h2><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>THINGS
GONE BY.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Once</span> more, who would not be
a boy?&rdquo;&mdash;or <i>girl</i>? and revel in the
delights&mdash;real or imaginary&mdash;of <i>things gone
by</i>?&nbsp; What a halo is round them!&nbsp; Their pleasures
were exquisite, and their very miseries have in remembrance, a
piquancy of flavour that is almost agreeable.&nbsp; I suppose the
habit of most of us who have attained a certain, or rather
uncertain age, is to revel in the past, to endure the present,
and to let the future look after itself.</p>
<p>Now this is all well enough for the sentimentalist, or for the
poet who, like Bulwer, can write at thirty &ldquo;on the
departure of youth.&rdquo;&nbsp; But to the
philosopher&mdash;that is, of course, to each member of
&ldquo;Pen and Pencil&rdquo;&mdash;another and more useful tone
of mind and method of comparison should not be absent.&nbsp; Is
not the present what was the future to the past, and may we not
by comparing the existing with what has been, as also with what
was the aspiration of the past, throw some light, borrowed though
it be, on what will be the present to our descendants?&nbsp; Mr.
Pecksniff observes: &ldquo;It is a poor heart that never
rejoices.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us manifest our wealth&mdash;of
imagination, shall I say?&mdash;by endeavouring to realize how,
through the falsehood and wickedness of the past, we have arrived
at our own lofty and noble eminence.</p>
<p>When we read, in the blood-stained pages of history, of
nations and continents plunged into warfare of the most horrible
and heartrending description, at the call of national glory or
dynastic ambition, how can we sufficiently rejoice at the soft
accents of peace and happiness <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>which none would now venture to
interrupt over the length and breadth of happy Europe?</p>
<p>The age of falsehood and party spirit may be said to have
passed away.&nbsp; Our newspapers tell nothing but truth, and the
only difference perceptible in their mild criticisms of friend or
foe, is that they betray a generous tendency to do more than
justice to their enemies.</p>
<p>If we cannot say that pauperism is extinct, yet we can
honestly affirm that, if we cannot destroy the accursed thing
itself, yet we can, and do so deal with paupers that the weakest,
at least, soon cease to be a burden on the rates.&nbsp; Science
and humanity have shaken hands, and the soft persuasions of
chemical compounds are employed to assist down any unhappy girl
who should be betrayed into aspirations towards the
chimney-pot.&nbsp; We all know that gluttony is one of the
greatest evils in the world, and which of our hearts could be
hard enough not to glow with rapture at the benevolent rule of a
London Union, mentioned in to-day&rsquo;s paper, of never giving
their inmates anything to tax their digestive forces between 5
<span class="GutSmall">P.M.</span> and 8 <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span></p>
<p>Again, when we read in our &ldquo;Spectators&rdquo; or other
venerable records of the follies of fashion of 150 years ago, or
indeed of any other epoch we like to recur to&mdash;of hoops and
paint, and patches&mdash;how may we rejoice at the greater wisdom
of our ladies in these days, in recognizing how beautifully they
blend the tasteful with the useful!&nbsp; Their crinoline, how
Grecian in its elegance; their chignons, how intellectual in
appearance; their bonnets, how well calculated to protect from
rain and sun; their trains, how cleanly; their boot-heels, how
well calculated to produce by natural means what the barbarian
Chinese seek by coarser methods&mdash;to deform the foot, and
thus, by limiting their power of walking, to leave them more time
for high intellectual culture.</p>
<p><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>Of
the improvement in our social morals it is needless to speak, and
indeed I must decline to do so, if only that in drawing a
comparison I should have to shock the ears of &ldquo;Pen and
Pencil&rdquo; with some allusions to <i>things gone by</i>.&nbsp;
I will but casually refer to two salient characteristics of the
enormities of bygone times&mdash;to novels and to the
theatre.&nbsp; Compare but for a moment the wild and almost
licentious writings of a Walter Scott, an Edgeworth, or an Austen
with the pure and unexaggerated novels of the present halcyon
time.&nbsp; And for our theatres, if it be possible to imagine
anything more chaste and elevating than the existing
drama&mdash;anything more stimulating to all that is purest, more
repressive of all that is vulgar and low in our ballets or
pantomimes&mdash;why, I very much mistake the realities that lie
before us.</p>
<p>Finally, in the religion of the country&mdash;there where one
looks for the summing up and climax as it were of all the
incidental advances we have glanced at, how glorious is the
spectacle!&nbsp; The fopperies of ecclesiastical upholstery
banished from the land; the hardness and cruelty of dogmatic
intolerance heard no more; a noble life everywhere more honoured
than an orthodox belief.</p>
<p>Surely we have reached the Promised Land&mdash;it overflows
with charity, with peace, plenty, and concord; and the only
regret left to us is the fear that in so good a world none of us
can entertain the hope to leave it better than we found it!</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Bringing about her, floating about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In and out through the long fair tresses<br />
Of her hair; oh! a thousand thousand idlenesses,<br />
Spreading away on May&rsquo;s breath everywhere<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Idleness,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or drinking
wind-wine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or looking up into the blue heaven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was counted a

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A time, harsh, not sublime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One terrible sort of school-<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hour all the year through,<br />
When everyone had to do something, and do it by rule.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, even the babies could calculate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two and two at the least, mentally, without a
slate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each calling itself an aggregate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of
molecules&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It was always school&mdash;schools,<br />
All over the world as far as the sky could cover<br />
It&mdash;dry land and sea.<br />

And whose shadows we trace on the Earth&rsquo;s face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now and then dimly?&mdash;Well,

Was as ignorant as she could ignorant be.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world wasn&rsquo;t school to

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who came singing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sweet Idleness, sweet Idleness&rdquo; up to

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she was
passing&mdash;<br />
And suddenly stay&rsquo;d for a moment basking<br />
In the broad light, with wide eyes asking<br />
What &ldquo;nay&rdquo; could mean to the soft warm day.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as she stay&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There stray&rsquo;d out from
her<br />
May breaths, wandering all the school over.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now,
the hard eyes move her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And her lips quiver<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the sweet notes shiver<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between them and die.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So her singing ceases, she<br />
Looking up, crying, &ldquo;Why is my May not sweet?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the wide sky fair?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the free winds fleet?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the feet of the Spring not
rare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That tread flowers out of the
soil?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh! long hours, not for toil,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for wondering and
singing.&rdquo;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, no, no, no,&rdquo;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These reply,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Silly fancies of flowers

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these things we know.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is nothing to wonder at,

Love, or fear&mdash;<br />

convict prison,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The eve of a summer day;<br />
Through the heated cells and galleries,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cooler nightwinds play.<br />
And slumber on folded pinions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With oblivion brought relief;<br />
Stilling the weary tossings,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Smoothing the brow of grief.</p>
<p class="poetry">Through a dungeon&rsquo;s narrow grating<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The slanting moonlight fell<br />
Down by a careworn prisoner,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Asleep in his lonely cell.<br />
The hand which lay so nerveless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had grasp&rsquo;d a sword ere now,<br />
And the lips now parch&rsquo;d with fever<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had utter&rsquo;d a patriot&rsquo;s vow.</p>
<p class="poetry">He stirr&rsquo;d and the silence was broken,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; By the clanking of a chain,<br />
He sigh&rsquo;d, but the sigh no longer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Show&rsquo;d the spirit&rsquo;s restless pain.<br />
For to him the dark walls faded,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the prisoner stood once more<br />
Beneath the vine-wreath&rsquo;d trellis,<br />

&ldquo;Let his fate be what Thou wiliest,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; What news do you bring to-day?<br />
What tidings of home and kindred<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the exile far away?</p>

The glorious moonlight&rsquo;s splendour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poured full on his humid brow.</p>
<p class="poetry">On its rays there floated to him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The friends of his early youth,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; And the winter&rsquo;s icy breath<br />
Blew chill through an empty dungeon:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The convict was freed&mdash;by Death.</p>

And this is how I came to grief,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon an Arctic whaler.<br />

118</span>REALITIES.</h2>
<p>I <span class="GutSmall">AM</span> informed by &ldquo;Pen and
Pencil,&rdquo; with a certain harsh inexorableness of tone, that
<i>something</i> I must produce this evening, or&mdash;incur a
sentence too dreadful to be contemplated, no less than that of
ostracism (perhaps ostracism for incapacity should be spelt
<i>ass</i>tracism).</p>
<p>Well, what are the words?&nbsp; <i>Realities</i> and
<i>drifting</i>.&nbsp; Very good; then I&rsquo;ll take both, for
the most characteristic element that I have noted of
<i>realities</i> is that they are constantly <i>drifting</i>.</p>
<p>Wishing to start from an undoubted basis, I asked a friend,
before sitting down to write, what exactly he understood by
<i>realities</i>, and he replied, with the air of a philosopher,
&ldquo;whatever man, through the medium of his senses, can surely
realize.&rdquo;&nbsp; The conclusion I draw is, that there is
some inextricable connection between <i>realities</i> and <i>real
lies</i>.&nbsp; In which I am confirmed by Johnson, who traces
the derivation of the word <i>reality</i> as <i>from</i>
real.</p>
<p>Sir John Lubbock, in his &ldquo;Origin of Civilization,&rdquo;
under the heading of &ldquo;Savage Tendency to
Deification,&rdquo; states as a fact that &ldquo;The king of the
Koussa Kaffirs, having broken off a piece of a stranded anchor,
died soon afterwards, upon which all the Kaffirs looked upon the
anchor as alive, and saluted it respectfully whenever they passed
near it.&rdquo;&nbsp; At a glance it occurred to me, this is a
<i>reality</i> well worthy of being brought under the notice of
&ldquo;Pen and Pencil.&rdquo;&nbsp; Will it not furnish, thought
I, material <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>for their philosophers, and mirth for their humorists,
and surely an excellent subject for their artists?&nbsp; <i>But
is it true</i>?&nbsp; Ay, that must be my first discovery.&nbsp;
Who shall hope to palm off doubtful <i>realities</i> upon
&ldquo;Pen and Pencil,&rdquo; without deservedly <i>drifting</i>
to disgrace?</p>
<p>Without indecent boasting, I believe I may assure this august
assembly that I have probed this matter to its very root; the
whole truth is in my hands, and shall be faithfully presented to
this critical company.&nbsp; I shall be excused from detailing my
method of examination; time would fail us were I to make the
attempt; suffice it to say that I have brought all possible modes
under contribution, and many more, and that not a single fact has
been set down unless previously tested by a wild flight of
imagination.&nbsp; Upon principle, too, I decline to say how I
have arrived at the realities of the case, lest truth should
suffer through disapproval of my process.</p>
<p>If I say that I have telegraphed direct, some wretched
caviller may observe that he never heard of Kaffir wires.&nbsp; I
may have conversed with the ghost of the wicked king of Koussa
Kaffir through the medium of Mrs. Marshall, but some
joker&mdash;how I do detest the race&mdash;might object to my
plan of <i>marshalling</i> my facts.&nbsp; I may have
&ldquo;asked that solemn question&rdquo; of the leg of my
loo-table, which does <i>not</i> by any means &ldquo;seem
eternal,&rdquo; something after the fashion of Ion.&nbsp; I may
have caught the little toe of Mr. Home, as he was floating in
mid-air, and so found my information, as honest debts should be
paid, <i>on the nail</i>.&nbsp; I may have&mdash;but no
more&mdash;I respectfully decline to communicate, to-night at
least, aught but the ascertained <i>realities</i>.</p>
<p>It is true, then, that a stranded anchor was thrown on the
shore of Koussa Kaffir; that it created widespread wonder and
inquiry as to its whence, its wherefore, and <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>its
whither; that the king, being of an inquiring mind, often
examined the anchor, pondered over its shape and its materials;
that one day, testing this last with too much energy, one fluke
was quite lopped off.&nbsp; His majesty was pleased with the
result, although it did not seem to do much towards solving the
difficult questions connected with the strange visitor; but it
was afterwards generally reported that some of the wisest of the
Kaffirs had shaken their heads three times, and had remarked that
if anything should happen they should doubt whether it was not
for something.</p>
<p>Something did happen.&nbsp; The king that night ate for his
supper forty-four ostrich eggs, beside two kangaroos and a
missionary.&nbsp; It was too much for even a Kaffir king; he was
seized with nightmare, raved of the weight of the anchor on his
chest, and died.</p>
<p>The effect produced upon Kaffir public opinion, and the Kaffir
press, was startling and instantaneous.&nbsp; The king had broken
the anchor; the king had died&mdash;had died <i>because</i> he
broke the anchor; that was evident, nay was proved&mdash;proved
by unerring figures, as thus: the king was fifty-five years old;
had lived, that is to say, 20,075 days; to say, therefore, that
he had not died this day <i>because</i> of his daring impiety was
more than 20,000 to one against the doctrine of
probabilities.</p>
<p>The anchor, therefore, was a power&mdash;was a devil to be
feared&mdash;that is, a god to be worshipped; for in savage
countries there is a wonderful likeness between the two.&nbsp;
Thus was born a religion in Koussa Kaffir.&nbsp; Divine honours
or dastard fears were lavished on the anchor; a priesthood sprang
up who made their account in the Kaffir superstition.&nbsp; They
were called anchorites.&nbsp; They were partly cheats, and partly
dupes; but they made a livelihood between the two
characters.&nbsp; They fixed <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>the nature and the amount of the
sacrifices to be offered, and the requirements of the anchor were
in remarkable harmony with the wants of its priests.&nbsp;
Natural causes, too, were happily blended with
supernatural.&nbsp; The anchor was declared to be the great
healer of diseases.&nbsp; For immense sums the ministering
priests would give small filings to the diseased, and marvellous
were the cures produced by oxides and by iron; never, in short,
was there a more prosperous faith.&nbsp; The morals of the
people, I grieve to say, did not improve in proportion to their
faith.&nbsp; An anchor that is supposed to remit sins on
sacerdotal intercession is probably not favourable to the higher
morals in Koussa Kaffir.</p>
<p>But a trial had to come upon the anchor-devil and its
worshippers.&nbsp; Under it it must collapse, or passing through
it as through the flame of persecution, come forth stronger and
brighter than ever.&nbsp; Which should it be?&nbsp; It was an
interesting spectacle.&nbsp; Let me finish my story.</p>
<p>There returned to Koussa Kaffir a native who had voyaged round
the world since he had left his native land; he had seen and had
observed much; he was well acquainted with anchors; had seen them
in all stages and under all conditions; he knew their use by long
experience; he had handled them.&nbsp; One time his vessel had
been saved by its stout anchor, another time he had had to save
the ship by slipping his cable and leaving the anchor at the
bottom; he had never known an anchor resent the worst usage; he
would not worship this old broken one.&nbsp; Some thought him
mad, some wicked; he was called infidel by those who knew his
mind, but for a long time he followed his friends&rsquo; advice,
and said nothing of his awful heresy.</p>
<p>But this condition of mind would hardly last for <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>ever.&nbsp;
Travel had improved his intellectual force, as well as given
special knowledge about anchors and other things; he began to
lament over and even to despise the folly of his race; he burned
to cast off some at least of their shackles of ignorance and
superstition.&nbsp; &ldquo;How shall I begin,&rdquo; cried he one
day, &ldquo;to raise their souls to something higher, while they
worship that stupid old rusty anchor in the sand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His soul began to burn with the spirit of martyrs and
reformers.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will expose this folly; I will break to
pieces their anchor-devil, and when they see that all is well as
it was before, they will begin to laugh at their own devil, and
will have their minds open to a higher faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But first he would consult his friends; if possible obtain
their sanction, and act in unison with others.&nbsp; He met with
no encouragement.&nbsp; One gravely rebuked him for his
presumption and conceit, and produced a long list of eminent
Kaffirs who had bowed before the anchor.&nbsp; Another found in
the absurdity of the anchor faith its best evidence of
solidity.&nbsp; It was, he said, a faith too improbable for a
Kaffir to have invented; any fool, he added, could believe a
probable religion, but it needed a superior Kaffir to swallow
this.&nbsp; Some put their tongues in their cheeks (a vulgar
habit amongst the Koussa Kaffirs), and said: &ldquo;Silly fellow,
we know all that as well as you do, but the anchor is a
profitable anchor, and as needs must, you shall be one amongst
the priests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, others said: &ldquo;We, too, have our doubts, but as a
political engine we must retain our anchor.&nbsp; How should we
keep down the lower orders?&nbsp; How restrain our servants from
pilfering without its influence and sanctifying power?&nbsp; The
fact is, that in our complicated <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>social system all society depends
upon the anchor.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Between ourselves,&rdquo;
one added, &ldquo;if heaven had not sent that particular anchor
some of us think we must have sent to Woolwich for
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the only arguments that caused him any hesitation, and
which did give him some pain, were from certain women who
implored him not to destroy their anchor idol.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
cannot judge,&rdquo; said one of these, &ldquo;between your
arguments and the conclusions we have been brought up to
reverence.&nbsp; The anchor may not be a god but only a symbol,
but how beautiful a one!&nbsp; Does not the anchor save the
ship?&nbsp; And are not our own lives, too, like the storm-tossed
vessel?&nbsp; That anchor is associated with all we have felt,
suffered, prayed for.&nbsp; Destroy that symbol, and you wound
and endanger the deepest element of religion in our
hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, one very intelligent friend said to him with much
solemnity: &ldquo;Rash man, forbear!&nbsp; Stop while there is
time in a course that may bring down ruin on the State and on
yourself, and for the doing of which you can have, as a rational
being, no temptation whatever.&nbsp; I grant you you may be
right, and the rest all wrong; but what then?&nbsp; We can know
nothing of the matter, and <i>you may be wrong</i>.&nbsp; Now,
anyhow, <i>we are on the safe side of the hedge</i>.&nbsp; If the
anchor be a devil he may do you harm, and if he be only a bit of
rusty iron, you will be none the worse for a bow and a
grimace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rash man was immovable.&nbsp; Doomed by the infernal gods
to pay the penalty of having lit his Promethean torch at Woolwich
dockyard, armed with a mighty hammer, and followed by an
awe-struck crowd, he fell upon the anchor, and with one mighty
blow, struck off the other fluke.&nbsp; It was his last!&nbsp;
Inspired <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>by religious zeal, the Koussa Kaffirs rushed upon him,
and in the sight of the outraged anchor beat his brains out on
the beach.&nbsp; It was observed that his friend who liked to be
&ldquo;on the safe side&rdquo; threw the first stone, and the
advocate of public morals was the next; after that they rained
too thick to tell who did the most.</p>
<p>Meantime the anchor of Koussa Kaffir will be worshipped for a
thousand years, for has it not slain the only two men who dared
to question its authority?</p>

<p>BOW-WOW!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m my master&rsquo;s dog; whose dog are you?&nbsp; I
live in a kennel, which somebody was good enough to make for me;
and I sleep on straw, which grew that I might sleep on it.&nbsp;
I have my meals brought to me punctually; and, therefore, I
conclude that meals are a noble institution and that punctuality
is a virtue.&nbsp; When I act as a good dog ought to act, I get a
bone, and my master pats me on the back.&nbsp; Therefore I always
do what is expected of me; and that I call morality.&nbsp; Dogs
which have no kennels flounder about in the gutter.&nbsp; Having
a kennel, I eschew the gutter;&mdash;and that I call
respectability.&nbsp; It is in the nature of dogs to lick their
masters&rsquo; feet.&nbsp; The best dogs do it, so I follow their
example;&mdash;and that I call religion.&nbsp; If I do what is
not expected of me, I get the stick.&nbsp; I do not like the
stick, so I behave myself;&mdash;and that I call
conventionality.&nbsp; There is a chain round my neck, lest I
should run away.&nbsp; I cannot break the chain, so I play with
it;&mdash;and that I call the proper subjection of the
individual.&nbsp; But I am free to pull at my chain till my neck
is sore;&mdash;and that I call liberty . . .&nbsp; For the rest,
I bark.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of spiritual beings: men, dogs, and
cats.&nbsp; Men are supreme, and made both dogs and cats.&nbsp;
Dogs were created for happiness, and cats for misery.&nbsp; We
are the good race, and they are the evil.&nbsp; It is the duty of
a dog to kill a cat.&nbsp; Then hate cats, and hang them up by
the tails in the back garden.&nbsp; If I <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>am a bad
dog, I shall be turned into a cat, and hung up by my tail.&nbsp;
Cats are fed on black beetles; but men are very happy, and eat
bones all day long.&nbsp; I eat a bone when I can get one; which
makes me think that I shall some day be turned into a man.&nbsp;
When I am, I shall hang up cats by the tails.</p>
<p>Of created beings dogs are the only ones who have souls.&nbsp;
There is a heaven for dogs, but for no one else.&nbsp; There are
no cats in heaven; and for that matter, very few dogs; but I hope
to be one of them; for there the dogs have meaty bones, and bark
all day long, making sweet music.&nbsp; This is the Dogs&rsquo;
creed.&nbsp; All who believe it will go to Bone-land; and all who
do not, will be hung up with the cats in the back garden.</p>

137</span>SWALLOWS.</h2>
<p>A <span class="GutSmall">NEW</span> season is begun.&nbsp;
Parliament met to-day.&nbsp; London is getting full, and the
price of coals has fallen.&nbsp; The celandine (swallow-flower)
is beginning to cover the hedgerow banks of the Isle of Wight
with yellow stars, and the swallows themselves will soon be with
us again.</p>
<p>I may mention as another agreeable sign of spring the return
of &ldquo;Pen and Pencil,&rdquo; not to the old nest, but under
shelter of the old hospitality.</p>
<p>The Rhodians used to salute the return of the swallows with a
traditional popular song, the <i>Chelidonisma</i>; perhaps some
lady present may gratify us with a chant of the like
purport.&nbsp; My own aim this evening is merely to give some
brief natural history notes on the British swallows, drawn partly
from books and partly from my own observation.</p>
<p>There are about sixty species of the family of
Hirundinid&aelig;, but only four kinds (counting the swift as
one) are habitual visitors of the British Islands&mdash;the
chimney swallow, the house martin, the bank martin (<i>Hirundo
rustica</i>, <i>urbica</i>, and <i>riparia</i>), and fourthly the
swift (<i>Cypselus</i>).</p>
<p>The chimney swallow (<i>rustica</i>) has a brownish-red
throat, back of blue-black lustre, under part of body
reddish-white, and a long forked tail.&nbsp; It is a bold bird,
and trusting to its superior speed, dashes at a hawk whenever it
sees one.&nbsp; It always builds near men, and <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>makes its
cup-shaped nest inside chimneys and old wells, in barns,
gateways, sheds, and arches of bridges.&nbsp; There are four or
five spotted eggs, and it brings out two broods each year.&nbsp;
The chimney swallow has a sweet little song of its own, and is
one of the earliest birds heard of a summer morning, beginning
soon after two o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; It is said to grow very tame
in confinement, but I never saw and should not like to see one in
a cage.&nbsp; These are the most abundant of our swallows, and
the same birds return year after year, while their little time
endures, to the same localities, and often very likely to the
same nests.</p>
<p>The house martin (<i>urbica</i>), or window swallow or
martlet, is smaller and less agile than its cousin just
described, and has a far shorter tail.&nbsp; Its feet and toes
are downy.&nbsp; It comes later than the chimney swallow, builds
amidst towns, on the <i>outside</i> of houses, under eaves and in
window niches, and chooses a northern aspect to avoid the direct
rays of the sun, which would crack its mud nest.&nbsp; Martlets
sometimes build on the face of cliffs, as may be seen at the
Giant&rsquo;s Causeway.&nbsp; It has four or five <i>white</i>
eggs, and brings out two broods.&nbsp; As a vocalist it can only
get as far as a chirp, or at most a small twitter.&nbsp; Its body
is white below, and purple on the back and wings.&nbsp; The house
martin does not, like the chimney swallow, sweep the ground and
water in its flight.</p>
<p>The bank swallow (<i>riparian</i>) or sand martin, which is so
sociable with its own kind but not with man, digs horizontal and
serpentine holes in banks, sloping upwards to avoid rain, where
it lays in a careless nest four or six white eggs.&nbsp; It has
sometimes, but perhaps not always, two broods.&nbsp; These are
the smallest and wildest of our swallows; nearly mute, or with
only a tiny chirp; and, when <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>they can, frequent large spaces of
water.&nbsp; They often fly waveringly with a quick fluttering of
wings, somewhat like butterflies, and anon sail circling like
other swallows.&nbsp; They use their old caves for some years,
but may often be seen digging new ones.&nbsp; They are probably
driven out sometimes by the fleas which, as I have often seen,
abound in their habitations.&nbsp; Birds, indeed, free and airy
as their life seems, suffer much from vermin, and the poor baby
swallows are terribly preyed upon.&nbsp; The sand martin is
mouse-coloured on the back and brownish-white below.&nbsp; It is
the earliest to arrive in England, and may be expected now in
three weeks or so.&nbsp; Next we may look for the chimney swallow
with his long tail&mdash;then for the house martin, and latest of
all comes the swift (<i>Cypselus</i>), which some naturalists say
is no true swallow, having several anatomical peculiarities, the
most noticeable being that all four toes go forward.&nbsp; No
other bird, I think (save the Gibraltar swift), has a similar
foot.&nbsp; The swift can cling well to the face of a wall, but
cannot perch in the usual bird fashion, and gets on very badly on
the ground, finding it difficult to rise on the wing.&nbsp; Once
in the air, with its long wings in motion, it is truly master of
the situation.&nbsp; It is one of the speediest, if not the
speediest, and can keep on the wing for sixteen hours, which is
longer than any other bird.&nbsp; The swifts are most active in
sultry thundery weather.&nbsp; They fly in rain, but dislike
wind.&nbsp; They are the latest day-birds in summer, and their
one very shrill note may be heard up to nearly nine
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Sometimes they get excited and dart about
screaming, perhaps quarrelling, but usually the swallows, all of
them, agree well among themselves, though they also keep a proper
distance.&nbsp; The swifts build high in holes of walls and
rocks.&nbsp; The Tower of London is one of their London
palaces.&nbsp; The nest is <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>bulky and has two white eggs.&nbsp;
There is but one brood in the season, and the swift leaves town
for Africa in August, going earliest, although he was the latest
to come.</p>
<p>Swallows for several weeks after their arrival in England play
about before beginning their nests&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Like children coursing every room<br />
Of some new house.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They wait for fit weather to go away, and may then be seen
sitting in rows as though meditating on their journey, perhaps
dimly sorry to part&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With a birdish trouble,
half-perplexed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Utterly mysterious and inscrutable to us are the feelings of
our lower fellow-creatures on this earth, and how the bird of
passage, &ldquo;lone-wandering but not lost,&rdquo; finds its
distant goal, is beyond man&rsquo;s wit to explain.</p>
<p>After this I fear tedious sketch of our four winged friends, I
will only add another word or two as to the name swallow, a
rather odd word, entirely different from the Greek
<i>&chi;&epsilon;&lambda;&#8150;&delta;&#974;&nu;</i>, and the
Latin <i>hirundo</i> (which, unlike as it may appear,
philologists tell us is formed from the Greek name).&nbsp; The
Italians call the bird <i>rondine</i> (evidently from the Latin),
and the French <i>hirondelle</i>.&nbsp; We get our word from the
Anglo-Saxon, <i>swalewe</i>, and the modern German is
<i>schwalbe</i>.&nbsp; What does this mean?&nbsp; I must own with
regret that it seems to me most likely that the name is given on
account of the voracity of this bird, which is engaged in
swallowing gnats, beetles, bees, may-flies, dragon-flies, and all
kinds of flies from break of day till sunset.&nbsp; The
Anglo-Saxon verb to swallow is <i>swelgan</i>.&nbsp; Fain would I
take the word <i>swelgel</i>, air, sky; but the Spanish name for
our bird seems conclusive for the baser derivation.&nbsp; The
Spaniards call it golondrina (evidently from <i>gola</i>,
throat); and it may <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>be added, make a cruel kind of
amusement out of the gulosity of the swallows, by angling for
them with fishing-flies from the walls of the Alhambra, round
which the birds dart in myriads on a summer&rsquo;s
day&mdash;descendants of those that played round the heads of the
Moorish kings, who perhaps were kinder to their visitors.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">OR, THE LAW IN 1874.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1868 it was determined by Lord
Cairns, then Lord Chancellor, that a revised edition of the
statutes of the realm should be published containing only such
statutes as were actually in force.</p>
<p>In looking over the first volume, which contains statutes
passed between 1235 and 1685, one is struck by the number of
stringent Acts of Parliament forming part of our present law,
which nevertheless are habitually neglected.</p>
<p>Now that the destroying hands of the Gladstonian iconoclasts
are stayed there can be no more useful task than to look around
us and see how many of these relics of the embodied wisdom of our
ancestors still remain to us, rusted indeed but ready for our
use.</p>
<p>In enumerating a few of these enactments I have two objects in
view.&nbsp; First, I would remind those whose province it is to
administer law and justice to the subjects of Queen Victoria of
powers with which they are armed; and, secondly, I would offer
timely warning to those against whom these powers, when again
exercised, which the present healthy state of public feeling
assures us they will be, must inevitably be directed.</p>
<p>To begin then.&nbsp; Can there be a more appalling spectacle
than the &ldquo;Monstrous Regiment of Women?&rdquo;&nbsp; Well,
we have our weapons of defence ready in 3 Henry VIII. c. 11., 34
and 35 Henry VIII. c. 8, and 5 Elizabeth <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>c. 4. s.
17.&nbsp; What a sound and vigorous ring is there in the first of
these statutes with the pains and penalties it enacts against
ignorant persons practising physic or surgery,
&ldquo;such,&rdquo; it goes on to say, &ldquo;as common
artificers, smythes, wevers and women.&rdquo;&nbsp; And how
discreetly liberal is the second of these statutes, which
indicates a legitimate field for women&rsquo;s activity, and
allows them, in common with all other unqualified persons, to
cure outward sores, such as &ldquo;a pyn and the web in the eye,
uncoomes of hands, scaldings, burnings, sore mouths, saucelin,
morfew&rdquo; and the like, by herbs, ointments, baths,
poultices, and plasters.&nbsp; But most practical, perhaps, of
all these three statutes is the statute of Elizabeth, which,
making no exception, sweeps within its enactments all women under
the age of forty who have failed to fulfil the great end of their
being, matrimony.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And bee it further enacted that twoo
justices of the peace the maior or other head officer of any
citie burghe or towne corporate and twoo aldermen, or twoo other
discrete burgesses of the same citie burghe or towne corporate yf
ther be no aldermen, shall and may by vertue hereof appoint any
suche woman as is of thage of twelfe yeres and under thage of
fourtye yeres and unmarried and foorthe of service, as they shall
thinck meete to serve, to be reteyned or serve by the yere or by
the weeke or daye, for such wages and in such reasonable sorte
and maner as they shall thinck meete: And yf any such woman shall
refuse so to serve, then yt shalbe lawfull for the said justices
of peace maior or head officers to comit suche woman to warde
untill she shalbe bounden to serve as aforesaid.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The effect of enforcing this law would be salutary
indeed.&nbsp; Under the existing state of things men are
frequently employed upon duties so disagreeable and ill-paid <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>that
Providence can only have intended them for women.&nbsp; Why then
do we not take advantage of the power, nay, the duty of sending
women to their proper sphere and mission which is entrusted to
our magistrates and discreet burgesses?&nbsp; As the wages will
be fixed by these authorities, the burden to the rate-payers need
not be great.&nbsp; And we should thus silence the demand which,
I am told, women are beginning to make not only for work (as if
their male relations were not always ready and willing to find
them plenty), but even for remunerative work.</p>
<p>But I pass from our women to our agricultural labourers.&nbsp;
We have lately heard much debate on the conduct of commanding
officers who, when labourers at harvest-time were holding out for
wages, allowed their soldiers to help in getting in the
harvest.&nbsp; But such aid would never have been required had
not the fifteenth section of the same statute of Elizabeth been
unaccountably overlooked.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Provided always that in the time of hey or
corne harvest, the justices of peace and every of them, and also
the cunstable or other head officer of every towneshipe, upon
request and for thavoyding of the los of any corne grayne or
heye, shall and may cause all suche artificers and persons as be
meete to labour, by the discretions of the said justices or
cunstables or other head officers or by any of them, to serve by
the daye for the mowing reaping shearing getting or inning of
corne grayne and heye, according to the skill and qualite of the
person; and that none of the said persons shall refuse so to doo,
upon payne to suffer imprisonement in the stockes by the space of
twoo dayes and one night.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor need our farmers at any other times in the year fear a
deficiency of labour if they will but invoke the aid <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>of the
fifth section of the same statute, whereby every person between
the ages of twelve and sixty not being employed in any of a few
callings mentioned in the Act, nor being a gentleman born, nor
being a student or scholar in any of the universities or in any
school, nor having real estate worth forty shillings a year or
goods and chattels worth &pound;10, nor being the heir-apparent
of any one with real estate worth &pound;10 a year or goods and
chattels worth &pound;40, is declared compellable to be retained
to serve in husbandry by the year with any person that keepeth
husbandry.</p>
<p>Again we have Acts of 1275 and 1378 (3 Edward I., and 2
Richard II.), as our defences against those who are described as
&ldquo;devisors of false news and of horrible and false lies of
prelates dukes earls barons&rdquo; and, comprehensively,
&ldquo;other nobles and great men of the realm,&rdquo; and also
of various officials enumerated, with a like comprehensive
&ldquo;and of other great officers of the realm.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Act of Richard II. reiterates and confirms that of Edward I., and
under these Acts &ldquo;all persons so hardy as to devise speak
or tell any false news, lies, or such other false things&rdquo;
about great people, incur the penalty of imprisonment
&ldquo;until they have brought him into Court who was the first
author of the tale.&rdquo;&nbsp; What a check would the carrying
out of these provisions put upon the impertinences of Own
Correspondents, social reformers, gossips, novelists,
caricaturists, and moralists!&nbsp; It will be a happy day for
England when the many thoughtless or malignant persons who now
permit themselves to retail stories inconvenient to members of
the aristocracy or to the dignitaries of the country, suffer the
punishment of their infraction of the law.&nbsp; To take but one
instance of the great need there exists for the protection of our
upper classes&mdash;an instance, as it chances, which enables me
to <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>show
that I would not wish the private character of even a political
enemy to be traduced&mdash;I may remind you that if the statutes
of <i>Scandalum Magnatum</i> were enforced there would not now be
at large persons ascribing to the late Prime Minister himself the
authorship of the Greenwich stanza on the Straits of Malacca.</p>
<p>There are many other statutes on which I might enlarge.&nbsp;
I might remind coroners of duties which they have forgotten, and
the clergy of rights which they are allowing to lapse, but time
will not permit me.</p>
<p>It is true that when I read my Statute Book I meet with some
provisions of which I do not comprehend the necessity.&nbsp; As a
Protestant I do not see why I should be imprisoned for three
years and fined besides, if I carry off a nun from a convent with
her consent; and as a botanist I do not see why, since January,
1660, I have been prohibited from setting or planting so much as
a single tobacco plant in my garden.&nbsp; Still, all are parts
of one stupendous whole, parts of the sacred fabric built by our
forefathers in &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne.&rdquo;&nbsp; Touch one
stone and the British Constitution may crumble.&nbsp; And as a
humble member of the Great Constitutional Party I desire to raise
my protest against the canker of decay being left to eat
insidiously into our ancient and revered legislative code, by our
suffering any Acts of Parliament which appear on our Statute Book
as parts of the living Law of the Land to drop into disuse, as
if, contrary to the doctrine of the highest legal authorities, an
Act of Parliament unrepealed <i>could</i> become obsolete.</p>

158</span>FOOTPATH<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Follow</span> that pathway till you
come to some arches, and turn under them, and you will find the
Blind School,&rdquo; was the answer given whenever we stopped in
our bewildered pilgrimage to inquire: but no arches were visible,
save one disreputable old bridge, under which no self-respecting
school seemed likely to find shelter; so we went on hopelessly,
asking the way from waggoners and countrymen, who all seemed
interested in the question, but were unable to give us any
guidance.&nbsp; A pitiless hailstorm rattled on our umbrellas and
splashed the mud upon our boots: while the path, it was evident,
was leading us on towards the river, not the school; so at last
in despair we turned, and flying before the storm sought refuge
under the despised railway bridge, where a group of children were
playing dry and comfortable, while we were wet and muddy.&nbsp;
Once again we inquired for the Blind School, and were told to go
on.&nbsp; The path led under a succession of iron girders which
apparently stand for arches in those regions, and we tramped on
discontentedly, feeling we had been deceived, and that we too
might have been dry and safe like the children, if only our
misinformants had called a spade a spade, and a row of iron
girders something else than arches.&nbsp; But the path took a
turn, and we saw cottages and green fields, and we reached a
house which had two doors, on one of which we read, &ldquo;Mr.
Wallis,&rdquo; and on the other nothing: so we chanced the <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>second
door, knocked, and were soon among a group of children, all neat,
healthy, and cheerful&mdash;but blind.&nbsp; In this blind school
there were but two people who could see, and these were not the
only teachers, for here the blind helped the blind, as the rich
helped the poor.</p>
<p>For this school began with a blind man.&nbsp; Five years ago,
near the banks of the Severn, a cart containing vitriol was
overturned; and of four people who were there, only two were left
alive, and one of these was blind.&nbsp; Childless and blind,
this man had to begin life again&mdash;to learn to live in
darkness, and in darkness to work for others.&nbsp; For as soon
as he had learned to grope his way, he learned to read in the
books provided for the blind, and went from village to village to
find other blind persons, and teach them how to read also.&nbsp;
Then a noble-hearted woman came forward to help him, and founded
the school; where blind children are trained to work as well as
read, and blind men and women come every day to be taught
trades.&nbsp; These latter come daily to the school, groping
their way along the path that had been so tedious to our
impatience; and learn to work, and also to read, helped sometimes
by the teachers, sometimes by the blind man: who also still goes
as before, from village to village, teaching and comforting those
in the same straits as himself.</p>
<p>We were guided through a back way, intricate and uneven, where
our blind guide warned us carefully of every step&mdash;though he
said the children ran about everywhere and never fell&mdash;till
we went through the school and entered his little house
alongside, and found ourselves in a bright little parlour
upstairs, full of books, and tastefully furnished, with a
woman&rsquo;s taste; for the woman who survived the accident
which left her childless and crippled, had still the sight of one
eye.&nbsp; There was an <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>harmonium in the room, and one of
the children came to play it.&nbsp; He was called Abraham; but
this old name belonged to an intelligent, bright-faced English
lad of twelve, well dressed and handsome but for his sad dim
eyes.&nbsp; He is the son of a well-to-do farmer, and in
education and intelligence far removed from some of his
companions.&nbsp; He handled the harmonium with his small,
delicate fingers as only a real musician can, and while the music
lasted I nearly forgot all the sadness of the scene, and the
hopeless life of the musician and the other children, who, one by
one, guided by the sound, crept up the narrow stairs and came
noiselessly into the room, and stood listening spell-bound till
he finished.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now, Lizzie, play,&rdquo; said some
one, and a girl came to the harmonium.&nbsp; She knew far less of
music than Abraham, and had as yet little execution, but the
sweet, true feeling which she gave to the old hymn tunes stirred
the heart and brought tears to my eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;And would
you like to hear us sing the hymn we sang when she was
buried?&rdquo; they asked.&nbsp; For their benefactress and
friend, the woman whose untiring energy had begun and carried on
this work among them, rousing sympathy for them among her
townspeople, and begging for them when her own means were
insufficient, died a few weeks ago, and the children of the
school had seen her laid in the churchyard.&nbsp; The harmonium
was hushed, Lizzie only struck the keynote, and they all sang, as
they had all sung at the grave in the cold February morning when
they saw her lowered into the cold earth,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I know there is a land where all is
bright,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and they turned their poor sightless eyes to the light, as if
that were to them the symbol of the heaven they longed to
reach.&nbsp; It was too sad.&nbsp; The singing ceased, and we all
<a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>tried to
speak of something else.&nbsp; &ldquo;How did you get that Indian
picture?&rdquo; I asked, looking round, and as the words left my
lips, I reproached myself for speaking to one who could not see
it, of a thing that could have no present interest to him.&nbsp;
But I had made no mistake, as it chanced.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay, my
brother brought it me,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know
what you mean.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is painted on ivory, is it
not?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh no! this is a picture; my sister
wears the one on ivory for a brooch, though it is rather large
for that, maybe; but my brother brought them.&nbsp; He was at
Agra during the mutiny, and he brought a ball in his shoulder,
too, back&mdash;that&rsquo;s what he brought; but I&rsquo;d
forgotten the picture till you mentioned it.&nbsp; But will you
hear the children read now?&nbsp; Read the history of England,
Abraham.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Abraham read, opening the book at
hazard, and reading clearly and distinctly the death of
C&oelig;ur de Lion, his forgiveness of his enemy, and his burial
in Fontevrault in token of his deep repentance.&nbsp; The
children all listened with pleasure till one little one, the pet
of the flock, whimpered because &ldquo;Bessie&rdquo; did not
read; so Bessie, whose fingers were busy with her knitting, was
compelled to read, although coming after Abraham it was rather a
trying ordeal.&nbsp; Still the pet had to be satisfied, and then
every one went on with their straw work, for the funds of the
home are dependent on charity or the sale of work, as friends
visiting Worcester will do wisely to remember.&nbsp; Straw mats,
baskets, and balls were the work of the little ones, and they
took the keenest interest in the question whether I preferred
blue and white mats, or purple and white.&nbsp; I bought both,
and shook hands all round, and in a few minutes was retreading my
way towards the broad rolling Severn.&nbsp; Never did I feel how
intense the joy of sight was as I did when I stood by its silver
stream, and thought of those I had just left in the little house
near the railway bridge.</p>

FOOTPATH.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Out</span> at the doorway
with shrill delight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ringing, clear of alloy,<br />
After a butterfly flashing so white<br />
As it wheels and floats in the soft sunlight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He darts, O adventurous joy!</p>
<p class="poetry">Away! the fields are waving, the wheat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stands proudly over the path,<br />
The path winds onward, winning his feet<br />
Through avenues arched and shady and sweet,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet vista that childhood hath.</p>
<p class="poetry">But stay: the butterfly has upflown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; High in the stainless blue;<br />
Under the shadowing wheat alone,<br />
He stands and wonders, still as a stone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For all the world is new.</p>
<p class="poetry">He sees each beautiful stem, blue-green,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing alone in its grace,<br />
Great pendulous poppies aflame between,<br />
And little convolvulus climbing to screen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That dim forest world from his face.</p>
<p class="poetry">He sees overhead as they dance to its tune<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ears flash white in the wind,<br />
But that musical laugh before mid-noon<br />
Ripples far and faint in the heat, and soon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaves silence only behind.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>And the silence falls on his fresh young soul,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the far sound of the sea,<br />
Infinite, solemn; its strange control<br />
Possesses him quite; quick fancies roll<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through his brain; half fearfully</p>
<p class="poetry">He looks; and the long path seems to strain<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; His tremulous lips apart;<br />
Some sudden trouble his eyes sustain;<br />
For so the folded blossom of pain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has broke in his childish heart.</p>
<p class="poetry">What is it?&mdash;some swift intuitive
glance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Half-shapen only in thought,<br />
Of stranger worlds, of wide mischance?<br />
Some intimate sense of severance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or loss?&mdash;I know not what.</p>
<p class="poetry">He turns and leaps; for his mother&rsquo;s
arms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the doorway lean;<br />
She folds him safely from all alarms,<br />
And rallies his courage with rhythmical charms,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet knows not what he has seen.</p>

164</span>FOOTPATH.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Onward</span>, where
through dewy grass<br />
Slowly wading footsteps pass;<br />
Where the daisy&rsquo;s peaceful eye<br />
Gazes trustful to the sky;<br />
Where the river rippling by<br />
Makes scarce heeded harmony<br />
With the deep bell&rsquo;s distant chime,<br />
And the wandering waifs of rhyme,<br />
Flung at random from the mind,<br />
While the thought still lags behind,<br />
Held in check by idle musing<br />
Born of chance, not wilful choosing.<br />
Now, more clear on either side,<br />
See the meadows green divide;<br />
Clearer lies the path before us;<br />
Varied sounds are floating o&rsquo;er us;<br />
All the stirring noise of life,<br />
All the ceaseless daily strife;<br />
The larger world breaks strongly in<br />
Where footpaths end and roads begin.</p>
<h2><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>THE
FOOTPATH.</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Remember</span> how, the
winter through,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While all the ways were choked with mire,<br />
Half-maddened at the rain, we two<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have nestled closer to the fire,<br />
And talk&rsquo;d of all that should be done<br />
When April brought us back the sun,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What gardens white with butterflies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What soft green nooks of budded
heather,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What moorlands open to the skies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We two would scour together!</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p class="poetry">And now the month comes round again!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cool interchange of genial hours,<br />
Soft gleams of sunlight, streams of rain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have starred the meadow-lands with flowers,<br />
And in the orchards on the hills<br />
The grass is gold with daffodils,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we have wander&rsquo;d, hand in hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where sea below and sky above<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seem narrowing to a strip of land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pathway that we love!</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Our path looks out on the wide sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And knows not of the land; we sit<br />
For hours in silent reverie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To watch the sea, and pulse with it;<br />
<a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>Its deep
monotonous refrain<br />
Brings melancholy, almost pain:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We scarcely wish to speak or move,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just to feel each other
there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sense of presence is like love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And silence more than prayer.</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Sharp round the steep hill&rsquo;s utmost
line<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It winds, and, just below, the grass<br />
Sinks with tumultuous incline<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To where the rock-pools shine like glass;<br />
The tufts of thrift can drink their fill<br />
Of sea-wind on this rugged hill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all the herbage, toss&rsquo;d and blown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is stain&rsquo;d with salt and
crush&rsquo;d with wind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save where behind some boulder-stone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A harbour flowers may find.</p>
<h3>V.</h3>
<p class="poetry">The bright sea sparkles,
sunbeam-kiss&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And o&rsquo;er its face such breezes float<br />
As lightly turn to amethyst<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The pearl-grey of a ring-dove&rsquo;s throat;<br />
Thus stirr&rsquo;d and ruffled, shines anew<br />
The radiant plain of changing hue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So gentle, that the eye divines<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No reason why the foam should
fall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So loudly, in such serried lines,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the dark rock-wall.</p>
<h3>VI.</h3>
<p class="poetry">The wind is low now; even here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where all the breezes congregate,<br />
<a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>The
softest warbler need not fear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To linger with its downy mate;<br />
And here where you have long&rsquo;d to be<br />
So many weeks and months with me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sit silently, or softly speak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or sing some air of pensive
mood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not loud enough to mar or break<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This delicate solitude.</p>
<h3>VII.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Are we not happy?&nbsp; Sun-lit air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Soft colour, floods of dewy light,<br />
A flowery perfume everywhere<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pour out their wealth for our delight;<br />
Through dreary hours of snow and sleet<br />
The hope of these wing&rsquo;d winter&rsquo;s feet;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We have them now!&nbsp; The very breath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Nature seems an altar-fire<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That wakes the bright world&rsquo;s heart from
death<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To satiate our desire!</p>
<h3>VIII.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Sing to me, therefore, sing or speak!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wake my dull heart to happiness;<br />
Perchance my pulses are too weak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To stir with all this sweet excess!<br />
Perhaps the sudden spring has come<br />
Too soon, and found my spirit dumb!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Howe&rsquo;er it be, my heart is cold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No echo stirs within my brain,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To me, too suddenly grown old,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This beauty speaks in vain!</p>
<h3><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>IX.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Why are you silent?&nbsp; Lo! to-day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not as it once hath been;<br />
I cannot sit the old sweet way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Absorbed, contented, and serene;<br />
I cannot feel my heart rejoice,<br />
I crave the comfort of your voice!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak, speak! remind me of the past!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let my spent embers at your
fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Revive and kindle, till at last<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delight surpass desire!</p>
<h3>X.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Yea! are you silent, only press<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My hand, and turn your face away;<br />
You wince, too, from the fierce caress<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That April flings on us to-day?<br />
O human heart, too weak to bear<br />
The whole fulfilment of a prayer!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This sudden summer strikes us dumb;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wild hope, realized, but
scares!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The substances of dreams become<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A burden unawares.</p>
<h3>XI.</h3>
<p class="poetry">How can we sit here and not thrill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With but the pleasure of past time?<br />
This footpath winding round the hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should stir us like remember&rsquo;d rhyme<br />
Nay! for the dull and sluggish brain<br />
Is spurred to action all in vain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And when the spirit cannot rise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through natural feeling into
light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No perfumed air, no splendid skies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can lend it wings for flight.</p>
<h3><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>XII.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Come, then, and leave the sovereign sea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To sparkle in the laughing air;<br />
Another day its face will be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No less refulgent, no less fair,<br />
And we by custom be made strong<br />
To bear what we desired so long;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To-day the slackening nerves demand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A milder light, a sadder air,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some corner of forgotten land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still winter-like and bare.</p>
<h3>XIII.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Come! leave our pathway for to-day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And turning inland, seek the woods,<br />
Where last year&rsquo;s sombre leaves decay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In brown sonorous solitudes;<br />
The murmurous voice of those dark trees<br />
Will teach us more than sun or seas,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in that twilight we may find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some golden flower of strange
perfume,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A blossom hidden from the wind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A flame within the tomb.</p>
<h2><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>THE
FOOTPATH.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">You</span> gave your hand
to me, as through<br />
The low scrub-growth that spanned<br />
The Danes&rsquo; old tower, we caught anew<br />
The sharp salt-burdened breeze that blew<br />
Across the reach of sand.</p>
<p class="poetry">Too proud! the grace you scorned to do,<br />
Where scarce your foot could stand;&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Twas but from sheer fatigue, I knew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You gave your hand!</p>
<p class="poetry">How well that scene comes back to view!<br />
Your cheeks&rsquo; faint roses fanned,&mdash;<br />
The gorge,&mdash;the twinkling seaward blue,<br />
The black boats on the strand;<br />
I gave you all my heart, and you&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You gave your hand.</p>
<h2><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>A
TURN OF THE TIDE.</h2>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
class="smcap">Only</span> a turn of the tide!<br />
I was sitting here, by myself alone<br />
On this rock, now hardly three hours agone,<br />
With my book on my knees, and my eyes on the sea,<br />
And my thoughts still further adrift, when he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So suddenly stood by my side.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shone white on the
sails,<br />
The waves were dimpling and sparkling in light;<br />
And I, my visions were almost as bright.<br />
But a mist is now creeping along the shore,<br />
And I shiver with cold&mdash;it is nothing more;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If it were&mdash;what now avails?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one turn of the tide!<br
/>
He told me his love was so deep and strong,<br />
That in saying him nay, I did him wrong,<br />
That I had not the right his life to break,<br />
And before I half knew the words I spake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I had promised to be his bride.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see his footprints
yet;<br />
Though the stealthy waves have almost effaced<br />
From the sand&rsquo;s dry bed the track they traced,<br />
But I feel as if years had gone over my head,<br />
As if I had died, and been raised from the dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since those sands were glistening wet.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>Only a turn of the tide!<br />
Is it always so when our dreams come true?<br />
Is the present so grey, and the future so blue?<br />
Is the rainbow we chased nought but drizzling mist?<br />
And the hope we hugged to our hearts and kiss&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Delusion, and nought beside?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had liked him truly for
years,<br />
I know he is greater and nobler than I,<br />
With a larger brain and a clearer eye;<br />
That my life is of small account, if it give<br />
Him comfort; but shall I, so long as I live,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Feel these half-unreasoning fears?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me! one turn of the
tide!<br />
This morning I was a careless child,<br />
So gay, so petted, so thoughtless and wild;<br />
I&rsquo;m content with my fate, but one more year<br />
Of freedom would have been very dear.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it I, or the wind that sigh&rsquo;d?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought so&mdash;here comes
the rain,<br />
The mist grows dense, and the clouds gather fast,<br />
And the tide has covered the sands at last;<br />
I must hasten, and think of regrets no more,<br />
But&mdash;could all things be as they were before,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not promise again.</p>
<h2><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>THE
TURN OF THE TIDE.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Far</span> up the shingle
crept the cruel wave,<br />
With seeming coy reluctance to his feet,<br />
Which&mdash;faint with toiling in the noonday heat&mdash;<br />
He let his foe with flattering murmur lave,<br />
Nor sought to flee the cool and pleasant grave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its soft arms laid about him, nor to cheat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The patient billow of its victim meet,<br />
For he had lost all power himself to save.<br />
When, while he waited, thinking death was slow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Eyesight and hearing dim with tired despair,<br />
The whisper of the sea grew faint and low,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, waked by stirring of the evening air,<br />
He rose, and saw the waves in sunset glow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gleaming far off in beauty new and rare.</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> harbour lights
are dim with smoke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which hangs about the under sky,<br />
And wraps the simple fisher-folk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In lurid mist as they go by.<br />
Along the shore the wind blows free,<br />
Keen twilight kisses the wan sea<br />
Far out; steer thither, watch with me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tender stars come out on high.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p class="poetry">The sky is deepening overhead:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sail flaps loose: the wind has died:<br />
The water laps the boat like lead:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Faint ripples plash against the side,<br />
And shimmer with unearthly light,<br />
The harbour lamps are out of sight;<br />
We drift into a starless night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Together on the ebbing tide.</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p class="poetry">How still&mdash;how strange&mdash;the tide is
slack,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We eddy round&mdash;we drift no more.<br />
What swell is this which sweeps us back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To where the gathering breakers roar?<br />
About the pale unlighted land?<br />
Can any tell if we shall stand<br />
Safe in the morning hand in hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the steep and rock-bound shore?</p>

I never said I&rsquo;d give it, but<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They swore &rsquo;twas all the same.</p>
<p class="poetry">They brought an action to extort<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Four thousand pounds from me&mdash;<br />
The Judge said &ldquo;compromise,&rdquo; and so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to give her three.</p>
<p class="poetry">By my hard fate, unwary youth,<br />

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Far</span> through the
vista of receding years<br />
I dimly catch a glimpse through falling tears,<br />
Of faces bending o&rsquo;er some pictured glory<br />
Or&mdash;brightly list&rsquo;ning to some magic story,<br />
Told by a gifted wielder of the Pen<br />
Whose power and pathos touch&rsquo;d the hearts of men.<br />
But when the pathos &rsquo;gan to sadden all,<br />
A comic writer would our smiles recall:<br />
And by his clever travesty and fable<br />
Excite a merry laughter round the table.<br />
Then some philosopher with voice sonorous<br />
Would read an essay&mdash;not too long, to bore us.<br />
The papers read, around the board we press&rsquo;d,<br />
To scan the pictures of each artist-guest.<br />
Then to discussion of a slight repast<br />
Of fish and rolls, and velvet cream we&rsquo;d haste,<br />
Ere Pens and Pencils all would speed away,<br />
To meet again some happy future day.<br />
That day, alas! has pass&rsquo;d, the night has come,<br />
And witty Pens and Pencils all are dumb.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
